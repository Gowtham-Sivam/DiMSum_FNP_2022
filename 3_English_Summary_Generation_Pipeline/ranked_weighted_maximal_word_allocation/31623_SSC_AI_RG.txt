These results reflect our position  as a leading provider of engineering services to many of the  UK’s critical infrastructure assets and in particular our  strength in the nuclear, rail and water markets.  Group revenue, including £2.2m from a joint venture,  increased by 6.7% to £560.8m (2016: £525.7m) with operating  profit prior to impairment, amortisation and exceptional items,  increasing by 16.4% to £25.6m (2016: £22.0m), an operating  margin of 4.6% (2016: 4.2%). After accounting for impairment,  amortisation and exceptional items of £8.9m, operating profit  was £16.6m (2016: £19.0m). After finance costs and tax,  earnings per share prior to impairment, amortisation and  exceptional items increased by 21.6% to 33.36p (2016: 27.43p).  After accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional  items, basic earnings per share on continuing activities was  19.88p (2016: 23.53p).  Exceptional Items At the end of April 2017, the Group decided to withdraw from  its loss-making low pressure, small diameter gas pipe  replacement activities and as a result reviewed the carrying  value of its investment in that business. The Board  determined that a non-cash impairment charge of £5.8m  should be made which is included within exceptional items.  This was reported in the interim results. Our gas operations  are now completely focused on medium pressure activities.  This restructuring has resulted in £0.6m of exceptional  charges relating to redundancy and other costs.  Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 6.0p per share,  increasing the full year dividend by 12.5% to 9.0p (2016: 8.0p).  The dividend will be paid on 13 March 2018 to shareholders  on the register as at 2 February 2018.

Operational Review Engineering Services Revenue has grown to £452.4m (2016: £436.2m), including  £2.2m from a joint venture. During the year, activity levels in  the Environmental market have been strong, particularly on  the current AMP6 investment programme which has seen  clients’ programmes move from early planning and design  phases into delivery. In Energy, revenue was lower than  2016 as we withdrew from the loss-making small diameter,  low-pressure gas market and a major scheme we were  involved with at Sellafield moved into the commissioning  phase. In Infrastructure, revenue in both Rail and Wireless  Telecoms increased. Our integrated multidisciplinary services are essential to  clients responsible for delivering maintenance and renewals  programmes in regulated markets. Our selectivity and direct  delivery model has resulted in an operating profit prior to  impairment, amortisation and exceptional items, of £25.1m  (2016: £21.5m), an increase of £3.6m (16.7%). The operating  margin on this basis improved to 5.6% (2016: 4.9%). After  accounting for impairment, amortisation and exceptional  items of £8.9m (2016: £3.0m), operating profit was £16.2m  (2016: £18.6m) resulting in an operating margin of 3.6%  (2016: 4.3%).  Our Engineering Services order book grew 4% in the period  to £438m (2016: £421m). The order book reflects our  established position in markets which benefit from long-term,  non-discretionary programmes supporting the maintenance  and renewal of key infrastructure assets. In the year, we extended our range of services in Rail with the  acquisition of Giffen Holdings Ltd (“Giffen”). The acquisition  broadened our offering as a major engineering services  provider to Network Rail, as well as providing services to  London Underground and
