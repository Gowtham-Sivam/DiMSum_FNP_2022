In the year to 30 September 2017,  we delivered a total shareholder return of  46.6 per cent compared to 13.5 per cent for  the FTSE 250 (excluding Investment Trusts).  With the growth in earnings, our proposed dividend  per share has also increased by 147 per cent  with a recommended final dividend per share  of 5.0 pence. Subject to approval at the AGM  on 25 January 2018, the dividend will be paid  on 9 February 2018 to shareholders registered  at 22 December 2017. T ogether with the interim  dividend of 3.4 pence per share, this will give a  total dividend for the year of 8.4 pence per share. Priorities of the Board The Board continues to regard corporate  governance as a core and vital discipline  complementing our desire to continually improve  upon the success of the Group on behalf of  our shareholders. During 2017, particular areas  of focus were to develop policies and procedures  to address the new Consumer Code for Home  Builders and to prepare for the introduction of  the Criminal Finance Act and the General Data  Protection Regulation.  Countryside has delivered another  year of significant progress completing  3,389 homes while maintaining a  strong balance sheet and with  excellent visibility over our future  growth ambitions. Well positioned for growth During 2017 the business continued to perform  well, delivering on the key targets set out at  our initial public offering (“IPO”) in February  2016. Political support for the housebuilding  industry remains strong and Group Chief Executive’s review The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives  of sector-leading growth, superior return on capital and building  resilience through the economic cycle.  Our Housebuilding model is based on an  industry-leading strategic land bank, all of  which is located in economically resilient  markets in Outer London and the Home  Counties. Over 80 per cent of our land bank  is strategically sourced via long-term planning  promotion, which offers Countryside over  ten years’ visibility of future supply, together  with an average 10 per cent discount to the  prevailing open market value. Additionally, as  73 per cent of this land is controlled via  options or conditional contracts, it ensures  both balance sheet efficiency and flexibility  through the cycle.  Overview of the market Overall the backdrop for the UK housing market  remains positive with continued strong customer  demand, favourable mortgage lending conditions  and good political support. During the year all  political parties recognised the need for additional  housing, not just because of the chronic need  for new homes but also because of the important  role that housebuilding plays in the wider economy.  In February 2017, the Government issued a  housing white paper, “Fixing our broken housing  market”, which set out a broad range of reforms  to help shape the housing market and increase  the supply of new homes. One of the main  themes of the report was a shift in focus from  home ownership to increasing supply of all  tenures of housing, including more affordable  and PRS homes. In October 2017, the Government  reaffirmed its support for housing, committing  a further £2bn of funding to deliver more  affordable homes and an additional £10bn of  funding for the Help to Buy scheme, which  currently runs to 2021.  Group strategy Our mixed-tenure model gives us the ability  to build sites out more quickly, delivering much  needed high-quality housing. We deliver this
