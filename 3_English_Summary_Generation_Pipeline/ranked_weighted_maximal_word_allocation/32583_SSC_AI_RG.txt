The Board  is recommending a final dividend of 5.6  pence per share to shareholders on the  register on 25 August 2017. This represents an increase in full year  dividend of 5% and continues Bloomsbury’s dividend growth each  year for over 20 years. The past year was Bloomsbury’s 30th and the 23rd year of listing on  the London Stock Exchange. Looking back to the time of the 1994  listing, the proposition was to be a medium–sized independent  publisher of works of the highest literary and commercial  quality. Although much has changed in publishing since then,  Bloomsbury remains true to its original publishing mission. The  current evolutionary phase is the digital resources growth strategy,  Bloomsbury 2020. This will accelerate the expansion of the Group’s  portfolio of high-quality digital products for academic libraries and  for professionals. To support Bloomsbury 2020 we are investing in  new products, technology platforms to fulfil them and B2B sales  processes.  Early in 2016, we simplified the organisational structure. The Group  now has just two publishing divisions, namely Consumer and Non- Consumer, supported by global functions for sales, marketing,  production, technology and finance. The new Consumer division  brings together, under Emma Hopkin, the Adult and Children’s  trade publishing divisions. This has coincided with Richard Charkin  reducing his time commitment to around two days a week. He  remains President of Bloomsbury USA, Chairman of Bloomsbury  India, and Managing Director of our Special Interest publishing. We  are delighted that Richard will remain on the Board. As Chief Executive’s Review B loomsbury has had a year  of strong progress – with  excellent revenue growth and  good strategic development through  investment in the Bloomsbury 2020 digital  resources growth strategy. Book sales,  and print in particular, continue to be  resilient in spite of political and economic  uncertainty.  Bloomsbury achieved excellent revenue  growth of 15% for the year ending  28 February 2017 (9% at constant currencies) resulting in total  revenues of £142.6 million (2016: £123.7 million). Profit before  tax and highlighted items was £12.0 million (2016: £13.0 million),  £1.0 million below the prior year in line with the guidance we gave  in May 2016 to reflect our £0.6 million investment in the Bloomsbury  2020 digital resources growth strategy and also the end of the  seven–year term of the Qatar Foundation contract in December  2015. During the year revenues generated by each of Bloomsbury’s four  territorial offices grew. The Group’s ambitious plans to grow in  Australia, announced in July 2016, saw Bloomsbury Australia grow  revenues by 50% (26% at constant currencies) from £7.0 million  to £10.5 million. Revenues in Bloomsbury India grew 46% (30% at  constant currencies) and the business made an operating profit  for the first time. 61% of Bloomsbury’s sales now originate from  customers outside the UK (2016: 54%). Book sales grew by 18% year on year to £133.3 million, with digital  sales, included in this total, increasing by 7% to £16.0 million. Digital  growth was driven by strong sales of digital resources. Rights and  services revenues were £9.3 million (2016: £10.6 million), being 7%   of total Group revenues compared to 9% in the previous year.  The Consumer division, and Children’s publishing in particular,  delivered an excellent performance, with its fourth year in a row of  double digit revenue growth.
