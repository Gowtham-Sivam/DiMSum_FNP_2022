We have recruited a  considerable number of highly experienced  individuals to create the right structure to  support the future growth of the Company;  in particular we have made further key  appointments to the construction team  as we move away from reliance on main  contractors and develop this part of the  business as an additional revenue stream. The Group achieved a profit before tax  and before revaluation of investment  properties of £18.1 million (2016 restated*:  £15.7 million) and a 4.3% increase in  EPRA net asset value of £194.4 million  (2016 restated*: £186.3 million). Including  revaluation of investment properties, the  profit before tax was £19.6 million (2016  restated*: £33.7 million). This is lower than  last year because of a revaluation uplift of  £18.0 million in the previous year at Wilton  Park, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. We  continue to make significant progress at  our flagship site of over 100 acres at Wilton  Park where a new information centre has  now been completed. I am delighted to  be able to report that an outline planning  application has now been submitted for  350 homes and commercial space on this  prestigious site. The site is producing gross  annual Chief Executive’s Review Our Group strategy continues to be focused  on the following four strategic goals: • Increasing the size of our strategic land  bank, including brownfield sites where  residential development is expected; the  tactical acquisition of sites which unlock  future potential; and locations which will  become key housebuilding terrain in the  future. • Adding value to our land bank by  navigating what are often complex sites  through the planning system, requiring  a unique skill set, and selling them to  other developers, realising attractive  short-term margins and generating cash  to fund our operations. • Maximising the value from our land bank  through housing development and direct  sales, as well as providing housebuilding  services to other landowners. • Ensuring a strong and flexible balance  sheet by maintaining borrowings at a  manageable level through a focus on  cash management and with a maturity  profile appropriate to our potential  future cash flows. With these in mind, it gives me great  pleasure to report on another set of robust  results for Inland Homes, demonstrating  strong profitability during the year ended   30 June 2017 and a further improvement   in both stated and EPRA net asset value at  the year end. Results and operations Profit before tax and before revaluation  of investment properties has increased  by 15.3% to £18.1 million (2016 restated*:  £15.7 million) with the majority of  realisations taking place in the second  half of the
