 COMPANY INFORMATION 145 ‘It was an interesting and challenging  year in terms of global news flow,  especially in the political and  regulatory sphere, but the year turned  out to be one of the least volatile in  financial markets for decades.

Of course, the changing face of regulation is dominating the  backdrop for IG’s core product at the moment. The regulatory  situation is in a state of flux, and it could take some time for clarity  to be available in all markets. I am, however, pleased that the  management and the entire IG team have continued to concentrate  on developing the business, while engaging constructively with  regulators and innovating to further improve client outcomes. The recent increase in regulatory concerns around retail leveraged  trading is perhaps no surprise. Like any growing profitable industry,  competition has increased in recent years. Unfortunately a number  of these competitors have been taking a very short-term approach  to this market and have been targeting inappropriate clients.  It is clear to me and the Board that IG is not the main target of  the regulators’ concerns. IG has always sought to operate to the  highest standards, and we are determined to assist regulators to  remove poor providers from our market and to improve consumer  outcomes. I also do not believe that the product itself is at the heart  of regulators’ concerns – this is primarily about the mis-selling of the  product by certain providers, either through unrealistic claims or by  targeting consumers for whom the product is inappropriate. We have a clear vision at IG: to be a global leader in retail trading  and investments. As a Board, we are concentrating on developing  a culture that drives behaviour focused on fair client outcomes,  and on the creation of a growing, sustainable business. Therefore,  we recently refreshed the values of the Group, to ensure all of our  people understand what binds the Company together |  IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017 16 IG Group Holdings plc • Annual Report 2017  | Company overview Strategic report Corporate Governance report Financial statements CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Given the tough external environment, I’m extremely proud of   the way our people at IG have pulled together over the past   12 months. Teams of employees have been working on our Brexit  planning, others have been heavily engaged in consultation with  our regulators, and more still have been working hard behind the  scenes on initiatives to further differentiate ourselves from our  competitors and to prepare IG to take advantage of regulatory  change – all of this while running the business from day to day. It’s  been a fantastic effort, and I want to thank each and every one of  our employees for their contributions during a difficult time. To guide our business going forwards, I am especially pleased to  have relaunched our Company purpose, vision and values this year.  Detailed below, I believe these statements articulate why IG exists  and what makes us tick. They underpin all our activity, express the  way we behave and set out our ambitions as we strive to achieve  our future vision for the Company.  To demonstrate our commitment to these statements, I and  members of my senior leadership team introduced them to  everyone in the business during a series of more than 50 global  workshops this summer. We also reminded ourselves where IG came  from – we have a history of true entrepreneurialism and innovation.  The feedback at those events was extremely positive, and I’m  confident that we have the right people to deliver our strategic aims  for 2018 and beyond.  Our purpose We exist to empower informed, decisive, adventurous people to  access opportunities in financial markets. Our vision To be a global leader in retail trading and investments. Our values Champion the client Understand them. Be part of their whole experience.  Think big, think long-term. Make every moment count  and
