It is a significant moment for the Group, and a natural time to   look back at the past four years, as well as to look forward   to the future possibilities created by GAP.  This includes the recommended offer made by Informa for   UBM plc in January 2018 that is currently progressing through  the necessary approval process: an exciting opportunity to create   a leading B2B information services group, with all the benefits   of operating scale and industry specialisation this brings. In the first instance, I would like to thank Shareholders for their  support over each of the last four years, as well as the Informa  Board for its input, direction, encouragement and challenge   over this period.  The participation and engagement of all colleagues across   the Group has been pivotal to GAP and the improving  performance, and everyone’s considerable contributions, are  appreciated and hopefully recognised in real time, at all levels. GROWTH ACCELERATION, GROWTH IMPROVEMENT The Growth Acceleration Plan was designed with a simple goal:  to progressively return every part of the Group to growth, while  simultaneously building the capabilities and platforms for future  scale and consistent performance. It was based on a conviction shared by the Board and the  management team, that Informa had many of the elements  necessary for higher levels of sustainable growth and   consistent performance: valuable brands, strong customer  relationships, market knowledge, talent, a culture of   commercial ideas and creativity.  It was also built on the belief that the Knowledge and Information  market was expanding at pace, and, along with many of the  industry verticals in which our customers operate, offered the  potential for long-term growth. From this starting point, we identified five key GAP objectives,   as set out on page 7: to repair and grow our Business  Intelligence Division, to streamline, focus and grow our  Knowledge & Networking Division, to build a scale position
