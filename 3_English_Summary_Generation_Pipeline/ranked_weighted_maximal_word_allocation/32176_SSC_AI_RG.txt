I am passionate about food, having started my career  as a food scientist, and have remained close to the  industry ever since. My path has crossed Tate & Lyle’s  on several occasions during my career and I am very  excited to join a company that I have long admired for  its strong heritage, values and expertise.  I am honoured to succeed Sir Peter Gershon who  retired on 31 March 2017 after serving on the Board  for eight years.

Adjusted free  cash flow was more than three times higher than the prior  year, and more than covered the dividend. Net debt was  £18 million higher at £452 million, with a £57 million adverse  impact from foreign exchange translation offsetting the strong  free cash flow generation. Overall, the Group’s performance in the year was extremely  encouraging. With both divisions performing well, higher  operating margins, and a robust balance sheet, the Group is  well positioned for the future.  Strategic progress We have a clear corporate strategy which we have executed  against in a disciplined way since the 2011 financial year – to  focus on growing Speciality Food Ingredients supported by  steady earnings from Bulk Ingredients. During the year we  continued to make good progress against this strategy. Consumers across the world are increasingly looking for  healthier nutrition, particularly given the rising incidence of  obesity and diabetes worldwide. Our Speciality Food  Ingredients business is well-placed to help our customers  meet these demands, as our ingredients help to reduce sugar,  calories and fat, and also to add fibre, in consumer products.  We are steadily bringing new products to market to address  these consumer trends, both through in-house innovation and  by establishing strategic partnerships. During the year, we  expanded our range of texturants with the launch of CLARIA ®   Bliss, a clean-label starch which provides great taste and  texture to products such as dairy desserts and chilled ready  meals. We also developed our sweetener range with a new  crystalline version of DOLCIA PRIMA ®  Allulose, a rare sugar  with a similar taste and texture to sucrose but only a very small  fraction of the calories. Overall, we invested £37 million in  research and development in the year, an increase of £8 million,  part of which was driven by foreign currency translation.  In March 2017, we announced an exclusive partnership with  Sweet Green Fields, one of
