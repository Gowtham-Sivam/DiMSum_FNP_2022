We increased Group operating profit by 51% to £197 million as our sales began to recover. User accesses also started to climb again during the year, reaching 328,000, an increase of 14,000 since the end of the first quarter. … and the low point? Unfortunately, our journalists and photographers are all too often exposed to danger as they report world events. I deeply regret that in the last year, three have lost their lives: Adlan Khasanov in Chechnya and Dhia Najim and Rashid Khaled in Iraq. Their deaths are a searing reminder of the heroism of Reuters journalists who put their lives on the line to report the reality of conflict to those of us who live in a safer environment.  Q You say Reuters is being transformed – from what to what? In short, from a company at the edge to a great company again. The Reuters of three years ago was at a crisis point. Our revenues were falling rapidly, we were losing market share, our costs were too high, and our organisation was too complex. Today, two-thirds of the way through Fast Forward, I’m pleased with our progress. We have strengthened our product line, we are meeting  our cost savings targets and we have done much to simplify the company and reduce our portfolio. It’s a tough process, and one that will continue this year, but it’s worth it because I truly believe we are on the way to making Reuters  a great company again.  Q What is being done to improve Reuters products? The answer, and our approach, begins with identifying and understanding customer needs. I think we are doing a much better job at this, and the results show in new or significantly improved products such as Reuters 3000 Xtra, Reuters Knowledge and Reuters Station. What I believe we need to improve  is speed of execution and responsiveness to customers.
