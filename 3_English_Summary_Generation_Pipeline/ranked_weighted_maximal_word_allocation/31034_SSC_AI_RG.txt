PROFILES DIVISION The Profiles division manufactures extruded rigid PVC  profiles and foam PVC products. We make rigid and foam  products using virgin PVC compound, the largest  component of which is resin. Our rigid products also  include recycled PVC compound, produced at our market  leading recycling facility. Rigid PVC profiles are sold to third-party fabricators,  who produce windows, trims, cavity closer systems, patio  doors and conservatories for their customers. There are broadly four types of fabricator. Trade frame  fabricators supply finished products to tradesmen or small  retail outlets. New build fabricators supply and install the  products they make for house builders. Commercial  fabricators supply and install products used in applications  such as office space and education facilities. Finally, retail  fabricators make products for sale via their own retail  operation, which may be a large national business, or a  small company servicing the local community. Most of  Eurocell’s customers are trade frame fabricators, although  new build is becoming increasingly important. Fabricators have production facilities which are customised to  the window or door system they make. As a result, fabricators  predominately buy profiles from a single supplier, which in turn  creates a stable and loyal 4 Proportion of revenue   in RMI market > 80% NEW BUILD Proportion of revenue   in new build  housing market > 10% < 5% BUILDING PLASTICS DIVISION The Building Plastics division distributes a range of  Eurocell manufactured and branded foam PVC roofline  products and Vista doors, as well as third-party  manufactured ancillary products. These include  sealants, tools and rainwater products, as well as  windows fabricated by third parties using products  manufactured by the Profiles division. Distribution is through our national network of 190  branches to installers, small and independent builders,  house builders and nationwide maintenance  companies. The branches also sell roofline products to  independent wholesalers. The Building Plastics division also includes Security  Hardware, acquired in February 2017 . Security  Hardware is a supplier of locks and hardware, primarily  to the Repair, Maintenance and Improvements   (‘RMI’) market.

See Our Strategy on page 20 VERTICALLY INTEGRATED  few transactions will likely hamper this. 8 EUROCELL PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRa TEg IC REPORT Chief Executive’s Review Market Context I am pleased to report a strong performance for the Group.  The Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (‘RMI') market  has been subdued during 2017, particularly during the  second half, reflecting low consumer confidence. We have  experienced an almost perfect storm of macro factors,  including increasing political and economic risk, the first  interest rate rise in ten years, worsening house price data,  low real wage growth and a weak pound driving material  cost inflation. Against this more challenging backdrop, we have made  excellent progress with our strategic priorities, continued to  invest significantly in the growth of our business and made  further gains in market share. Financial Performance We have reported robust financial results for 2017 and  delivered higher revenues and profits. Overall, sales growth was good at 8% (excluding  acquisitions). Growth was driven by our specifications  teams, which have continued to be successful in  generating demand for our products with architects and  planning authorities in the private new build sector, and by  the continued expansion of our branch network. Profitability was solid, having been impacted by   the weaker second-half markets and increasing   cost inflation we have seen for resin, other  raw materials and traded goods. We are   implementing selling price increases to   mitigate pricing pressure where possible,   but the market does lag supplier price   increases, so there is
