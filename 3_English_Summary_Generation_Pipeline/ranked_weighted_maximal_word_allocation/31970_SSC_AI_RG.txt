We achieved a record turnover  of £536.8m with an underlying revenue  growth of 14% at constant exchange  rates*. We report an adjusted profit  before tax of £109.1m* and a statutory  profit before tax of £117.1m, an  increase of 25% on an adjusted basis.  Our total shareholder return during the  year was 67%, ranking Renishaw in  the top 25 in both the FTSE 250 and  FTSE 350. Renishaw is a long-term business  and we remain committed to strategic  investments and R&D. In addition,  over the past year, we have focused  on underperforming business areas  resulting in our discontinuing the  activities of Renishaw Diagnostics  Limited and the spatial measurement  business. In spite of the potential  headwinds brought about by the  uncertainty of Brexit, we remain  confident of future growth due  to our innovative product base,  extensive global sales and marketing  presence, and relevance to high- value manufacturing. Revenue We achieved record turnover with  revenue for the year ended 30th June  2017 of £536.8m, compared with  a restated £427.2m for last year, an  increase of 26%.

This has resulted in the prior year profit  before tax being restated and as a  consequence the Board has introduced  an alternative performance measure,  adjusted profit before tax, to report  the profitability on the basis that all  forward contracts are accounted for as  effective hedges.
