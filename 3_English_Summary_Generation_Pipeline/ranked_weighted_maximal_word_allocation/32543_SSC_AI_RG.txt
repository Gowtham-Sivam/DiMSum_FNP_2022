A first half decline in revenues was followed  by a return to underlying growth in the  second half. Further self-help measures  have been delivered this year which reflect  our ongoing commitment to the core  objectives of our STEP 2020 Strategic Plan. These include the completion of two  consolidation projects, the sale of two major  properties in France and Australia and the  successful integration of the Tooth Chain  acquisition, which continues to trade ahead  of expectations. We believe this sets a  template for further successful acquisitions  in the remaining years of the plan. Our Markets Renold’s global presence and extensive  product offering result in a broad spread  of end-customer industries. Customers  are served either directly, or through  distribution partners, and our products  are used to satisfy maintenance and repair  requirements in addition to supporting  the manufacture of new equipment.  Our end-customers generally operate in  industrial markets which have continued  to be impacted by broader macroeconomic  factors and geopolitical uncertainty.  During the year, market conditions proved  particularly challenging in North America,  impacting upon both Chain and Torque  Transmission operations in the region  and resulting in a combined 8% decline  in regional revenue. Europe and China  experienced growth, and in flat markets,  we believe this is a result 16 Renold AR2017-Proof3.indd   16 6/7/2017   2:57:30 PM 25290-04    AR 2017    Proof 3                             Phase I  Restructuring 1        Phase II Organic Growth        Phase III Acquisitions   2 3 5.0  pence 4.7  pence 4.6  pence EPS 1.4  pence 3.2  pence March 2013 March 2014 March 2015 March 2016 Achieve  streamlined  business ﬁt for future Mid teens %  margins The market for industrial chain remains highly  fragmented across geographies and sector  niches.  As we have demonstrated from the  successful acquisition of the Gronau based Tooth  Chain business, selected acquisitions have the  potential to deliver incremental shareholder  value. This value derives from:   consolidating volume into facilities with   efﬁcient business processes and efﬁcient   manufacturing capability; or    accessing incremental growth     opportunities in new product sectors or    new geographies, building on the      strength in depth of Renold’s existing  product range and geographic reach. Renold has the underlying characteristics  to make the Group a natural consolidator  in the industrial chain market. As the  Number 2 by sales we have the reputation,  scale and product range to operate as a  strong foundation for integration. Enhanced customer service We believe Renold’s reputation for quality and  performance is unsurpassed in the market.   However, historically our performance in customer  service has not lived up to the same standards.  To  address this, we have implemented strategies to  introduce 24, 48 and 72 hour response times on a  range of standard and conﬁgured chains and  extended this concept to standard gear and  coupling products.  We intend to continue to  improve and evolve our offering to enhance the  levels of service to our
