Included within this  metric is the cost of vacant space and so letting  this available space will improve this cost metric.    We have been successful in securing both equity  and debt capital for supporting the expansion of   the business although there is no certainty that  future expansion will be supported in the same way.  We believe the fundamentals of the business remain  very strong and attractive to both equity and   debt funders.
