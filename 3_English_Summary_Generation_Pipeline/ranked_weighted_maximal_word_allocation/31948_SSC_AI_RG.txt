Strategic report 6 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 “Rank remains in a strong  financial position, possesses   market-leading brands and   has a clear strategy for   long-term growth.” Responsible gambling As an operator, Rank is committed to minimising the  potential for harm from gambling. This year we made  significant steps to increase the scale and impact of  our response regarding the prevention and detection  of problem gambling through: ◊ a newly formed board responsible gambling  committee (see page 68 for more details); ◊ the development of propensity models to detect  patterns of play symptomatic of problem gambling; ◊ investment in resourcing a team solely focused on  responsible gambling; and ◊ the development of our new Customer Solutions  Hub in Sheffield to better support our customers. More detail of our responsible gambling strategy can  be found in the operating responsibly section of  this report. Management team changes In September 2016, Alan Morgan joined Rank as  managing director of Mecca’s retail business. Alan   has held several senior positions within the hospitality  and leisure sector. Alan’s last role was chief operating  and commercial officer for Spirit Pub Company until  it was sold to Greene King plc. On Alan’s appointment, Martin Pugh became  managing director of Grosvenor Casinos’ retail  business after 21 months as managing director  of Mecca. On 30 June 2017, the Group’s human resources  director, Sue Waldock, retired after 28 years with the  Group. Following Sue’s retirement, David Balls was  appointed to succeed her.

Strategic report 18 | The Rank Group Plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 In Spain, where the economy continues to recover,  our Enracha business had a very positive year with  revenues and profits 1  up 23% and 72% respectively.  Although just nine bingo clubs, with a digital service  fully launching in 2017/18 and with possibilities on  the retail side, we are excited about Enracha’s  continuing growth potential. We also continued to look at how we could best run  the centre of our organisation, closing our central  London office and moving to a larger and more  modern Maidenhead headquarters. The resulting  workspace has led to a much more unified  organisation and a positive environment. Where do the Company’s priorities lie  in the next 12 months? Beyond achieving performance targets and all our  brands showing solid growth, we are focused on   five specific areas which will help drive growth and  long-term value. In the course of 2017/18, we will  launch a single account and wallet product across   our Grosvenor channels. It will see the delivery of   a complex solution combining different systems   and technologies from a range of partners and  suppliers. The result will be a joined-up retail and  digital business with customers being able to move  seamlessly between the two, which should drive  activity and volumes in both. We will also be  launching a number of new digital brands this year,  which should also help digital growth. Although  Mecca and Grosvenor are strong, established brands,  they appeal to a certain customer segment and having  additional brands will give us an improved ability to  ‘cross-sell’ customers into new brands and reactivate  dormant customers. Grosvenor’s nine London casinos generate  approximately half of its profit. Whilst successful  clubs in their own rights, they have historically been  run fairly independently and have not utilised their  combined benefit to full effect. Implementing a clear  Grosvenor London strategy is therefore a priority for  the
