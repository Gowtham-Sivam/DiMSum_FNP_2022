COMMUNISIS AT A GLANCE VALUE FOR CLIENTS Across the markets in which we operate, common  themes which enable clients to maximise the benefits  of the products, services and insight we provide have  enabled us CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT Strategic Report 09 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 CASE STUDY FMCG BRAND COUNTERING RETAIL OVERLOAD Introducing customers to a wider range  of products was a challenge that  produced excellent results. Before they  came to us, over 75% of the coffee brand’s  sales came from just two products,  making the need for more emphasis on  their wider portfolio stronger than ever.  Our team devised a new campaign that  involved segmenting each brand into a  range of different coffee-drinking  occasions. This has helped to transform  this brand and remains hugely popular  and successful among consumers today.  NEW SPLIT OF SALES  Digital transformation will have other positive impacts on  Communisis. For example it will allow us to extend the application of  data analytics as a service and capture opportunities for the  digitisation of our services for marketing execution. • Global Reach is the recognition that many of our clients are truly  international businesses and expect our services to be available in  an increasing number of territories. We already have 30% of our  sales in overseas markets and a prudent approach in EMEA has  seen our network expand through our main hubs in Paris, Madrid,  Rome, Warsaw and Frankfurt and eastward as far as Istanbul  and Dubai. We have announced that we will be opening an office  in Hong Kong for the sourcing of “premiums”; the gifts CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 12 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report 13 Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 With the increased sales in the craft drinks sector (whether  that be beers, gins, etc.), major brand businesses have needed  to respond to keep on-shelf presence in supermarkets. Brands  are therefore offering more events or Gift with Purchase (GWP)  to keep their in-store presence and increase sales. As a result,  we have seen a marked increase in the requirement for fast  turnaround co-packing of GWP for major shopping events  (Christmas, Father’s Day and other anniversaries). We expect  to see this trend increase in 2018. The broader agency market dynamic is changing significantly  at present, driven largely by the entrance of consultancy-based  businesses into the sector. This has increased commoditisation  of service and has led to a reduction of fees. That said, with the  increased pushback on the lack of transparency online, agencies  are being asked to deliver more demonstrable sales and can  charge for that effectiveness. In addition, there are increased  calls to design products for in-store that can be used efficiently  as well as effectively to reduce costs and increase sales. There  remain strong opportunities in brand awareness and product  launches and this is where, for example, our agency Twelve  has been successful. We still anticipate further consolidation within our sectors. As we  focus increasingly on provision of
