I would  like to take this opportunity to  welcome all our new shareholders.  Overview of the year The Nexus business model, with  Tamdown’s well-established market  position as a leading provider of  essential infrastructure services  to the UK’s largest housebuilders,  coupled with TriConnex’s growing  utilities connection services, was  resilient during a challenging year.  As previously reported, the EU  Referendum caused a slowdown  in tendering activity and delays to  customers awarding new contracts  during the second half of 2016  with a corresponding delay to work  commencing on site. In spite of  this market backdrop, the Group  is reporting revenue for the year  of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m), and  an operating profit of £9.3m  (2016: £10.4m). As at 30 September  2017, the order book was at a record  level of £202.7m up 25% from  £161.7m in 2016, providing good  earnings visibility for the year ahead.

The Group’s strategy is to  Executive review Group operating results As anticipated and as highlighted  earlier in the year, the outcome  for the Group’s full year revenues  of £135.0m (2016: £135.7m) were  relatively flat reflecting the impact  of the EU Referendum. Revenues  for Tamdown were £105.6m  (2016: £112.4m) and were broadly  offset by the 26.3% increase in  TriConnex’s revenues to £29.5m  (2016: £23.3m).  Gross profit for the year increased  to £27.2m (2016: £26.3m), with the  overall gross margin improving  by 78 basis points to 20.2%  (2016: 19.4%). Administrative expenses for the  Group increased by £2.0m to  £17.9m (2016: £15.9m). The 12.4%  increase was primarily due to  investment for growth within  TriConnex, where the planned  office headcount has increased  by 27, along with salary increases.  Group operating profit, which  has been recorded before the  deduction of exceptional costs,  for the year was £9.3m (2016:  £10.4m). Group operating margin  decreased to 6.9% (2016: 7.6%),  with the gross margin improvement  offset by the significant investment  in administrative expenses to  support future growth. Exceptional items totalling £1.7m  (2016: nil) were recorded in the year  to reflect the costs related to the IPO.  Profit for the year attributable  to equity holders of the parent  company was £5.8m (2016: £8.4m).  Basic earnings per share were 15.4p,  after the impact of the exceptional  items (2016: 22.3p). The underlying  basic earnings per share, adjusting  for the exceptional items, were 19.1p  (2016: 22.3p).  The Group’s balance sheet remains  strong, with net assets growing  by
