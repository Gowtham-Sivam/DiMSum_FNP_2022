Overview Since setting out our Moving Up A Gear strategy 18  months ago, excellent progress has been made across  each of the five key pillars that underpin the strategy.  This has been reflected in robust sales growth, an  expanded knowledge of our customer preferences,  further improvements in service levels, many new and  unique product introductions, progress in building a  fit for purpose infrastructure and strong growth in our  value-added service offerings. T o this end, and on behalf  of the Board, I would like to thank our Management team  and our 10,000 plus colleagues for their hard work and  commitment in driving the business forward and for their  passion to help our customers on their journeys. Performance We achieved solid sales growth from our Motoring  activities, in both Retail and Autocentres, and strong  growth in Cycling where we continued to register  market share gains and can uniquely offer customers  the full range: from children’s balance bikes to high  end performance road bikes. Whilst the depreciation  in Sterling following the EU referendum and other cost  headwinds, such as the introduction of the National Living  Wage, clearly impacted earnings, the underlying business  performance was positive and cash flow was robust. We applied our capital allocation policy consistently:  firstly, by further investment in our colleagues and our  infrastructure; secondly, with an increased ordinary  dividend; thirdly, with two complementary acquisitions –  100% of T redz and Wheelies in May 2016 and a minority  stake in TyresOnTheDrive.com in January 2017; and,  thereafter, by paying a special dividend of 10 pence per  share in February 2017. Progress was thus made towards  our debt target of 1 times EBITDA. In line with our policy  of paying an increasing ordinary dividend, the Board has  recommended a final dividend of 11.68 pence per share, Chief Executive’s Statement The underlying business  performance is strong and we  remain confident in the long-term  prospects for the Group. We are pleased with the sales  performance this year, with  growth across all areas of our  business and market share  gains in both Motoring and  Cycling.  It is now 18 months since we launched the Moving Up A  Gear strategy, aimed at modernising the business and  consolidating our position as a specialist, service-led  retailer in order to drive sustainable long-term growth.  In this report we set out the strong progress in the year,  alongside good sales performance and continued market  share gains. Strategic Progress Our goal is to be customers’ first choice for their life on  the move and we will achieve this by being committed to  Making Customers’ Journeys Better. Our Group strategy  has five key pillars: Putting Customers in the Driving Seat  — investing in customer data and insight  capabilities to maximise the lifetime customer  value  Service in Our DNA   — embedding the focus on customer service Building on Our Uniqueness   — exclusive products, relevant innovation and  unique partnerships Better Shopping Experience   — a seamless customer experience, online as  well as in store Fit for the Future Infrastructure   — moving from fixing the basics to improving  efficiency and fulfilment  On pages 16 and 17 we have set out a more detailed  explanation of the Group strategy, our progress on each  of these pillars during FY17 and the key areas of focus   for FY18.
