However, for the past fi nancial period, the fi rst  full year following the Company’s listing on the London  Stock Exchange, the Group was unable to deliver its  consistent growth in underlying earnings per share  achieved in the past, largely due to challenges in our  Middle East platform. Our expansion into Abu Dhabi, eff ectively doubling the  size of the Middle East business following the Al Noor  Combination, has not met our original expectations.  Our growth forecasts for the Abu Dhabi operations  were signifi cantly impacted in the short term due to  unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment and  a greater need to align Al Noor with the sustainable  business and operational practices of the Mediclinic  Group. As a result, revenue and underlying EBITDA  margins during the year were lower than expected in  the Middle East. Despite the challenges in Abu Dhabi,  our established Dubai operations continued to perform  well. The new Mediclinic City Hospital North Wing  opened in the third Non-executive Chairman MEDICLINIC ANNUAL REPORT 2017 11 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW DURING A CHALLENGING YEAR,  WHAT HAVE BEEN THE KEY  HIGHLIGHTS FOR YOU? Having been with the Group for some 30 years, it is  fair to say that this past year was one of the most  challenging. Despite the diffi  cult trading environment,  a key highlight was the Swiss, Southern African and  Dubai businesses all performing relatively well. We  continue to see growing demand for quality healthcare  services, which is why we place such an emphasis on  our Patients First strategy and continue to invest in our  facilities and people. This will assist us to maintain our  leading position in all our international markets. The  key challenge globally is to keep healthcare aff ordable  and to demonstrate cost-effi  cient service delivery.  Whilst the Middle East platform performed below  expectations during the year, largely resulting from  issues with the Al Noor business in Abu Dhabi,  there were several highlights in the region. In  September 2016, we opened the new comprehensive  cancer unit, based in the North Wing of the Mediclinic  City Hospital, which has healthcare sector.
