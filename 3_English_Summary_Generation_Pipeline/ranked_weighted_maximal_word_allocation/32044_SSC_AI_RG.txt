Firstly,  the past year has been very challenging,  both operationally and financially.  Business performance has fallen short  of expectations, we have outgrown some  of our business processes and controls,  Financial highlights   z Group revenue grew by 17 per cent to £244.5m (2016: £209.1m) made up of:   — Organic growth of 3 per cent (excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions)  — Impact of acquisitions (prior year and current year): £21.1m (all in Assurance)  — Impact of changes in foreign exchange rates: £9.8m  z In terms of business segments, underlying organic growth can be broken down as follows:  — Assurance – UK Security Consulting: 19.4 per cent; US Assurance: 13.9 per cent  — Assurance – Software Testing and Web Performance: down 1 1.3 per cent  — Escrow: 0.3 per cent rise  z Adjusted 1  EBIT: £27 .5m (2016: £39.7m)  z Operating loss: £53.4m (2016: £1 1.4m profit)  — Assurance Adjusted EBIT down to £16.6m (2016: £25.8m)   — Escrow Adjusted EBIT down to £19.1m (2016: £20.1m)  — Head office costs increased  z Acquisitions completed of two small bolt-on businesses in the US to enhance the product offering of our existing Assurance  businesses and expand our US footprint. Outlook for 2017/18  z Implement new Target Operating Model to drive more effective “Go to market” strategies and operational efficiencies.  z Leverage high value products and services from acquisitions through the NCC Group global footprint and sales channels by  lowering internal barriers to Group-wide co-operation.  z Short-term focus on internal self-help measures and efficiencies in a buoyant market will deliver margin growth 1  This is a non-GAAP or Alternative Performance Measure (APM). Adjusted figures exclude the amortisation of acquired intangibles,  individually significant items, share-based charges, the unwinding of discount on deferred and contingent consideration, the results of  the exited Domain Services business and any associated tax thereon.

Various types of criminals, and  at times, nation states, have targeted their continuously evolving techniques for  financial gain at banks and other financial institutions and their customers across  the globe.

The information may be  used for competitive advantage or to support geopolitical goals. The damage  resulting from espionage campaigns is often material and the impact can  sometimes only be gauged after time.
