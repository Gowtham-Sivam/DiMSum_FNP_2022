Annual Report 2017 04 Strategic report 2017 has been a year of heightened global  and political uncertainty and prospects of  continued volatility across markets. In a  world where change is happening at an  ever‑increasing pace, our strategy to be the  UK’s leading income focused REIT is well  placed. I am therefore pleased to report  another solid set of results, with underlying  earnings per share at 2.75 pence, in line with  recent guidance and EPRA NAV per share up  3.5 per cent to 41.4 pence. Results and dividend Underlying earnings increased by 7.6 per  cent to £49.8 million (2016: £46.3 million).  Underlying earnings per share are in line with  guidance at 2.75 pence and form the base  from which we will grow income in line with  our medium‑term growth target of 3.0 to  5.0 per cent per annum. EPRA NAV increased by 3.5 per cent to  41.4 pence per share (2016: 40.0 pence per  share) supported by a 3.0 per cent like‑for‑like  increase in the value of the Group’s portfolio.  The Board has declared a second interim  dividend of 1.3 pence per share taking  dividends declared for the full year to  2.6 pence per share. The full year dividend  reflects a pay-out ratio of 94.5 per cent  of underlying earnings, delivering on our  strategic priority of distributing superior  income returns which are fully covered  by underlying earnings and aligned with  operating cash flow. The total dividend for  the year of 2.6 pence per share reflects a  6.3 per cent yield on EPRA NAV, over 50 per  cent higher than the UK‑REIT average of  4.1 per cent. Strategic priorities In February 2017 we held an inaugural Capital  Markets Day and set out the Company’s  strategic priorities which have the goal of  delivering superior, sustainable and growing  income returns. Following a period of  significant growth and transactional activity  these priorities underline our ongoing  ambition to become the UK’s leading   income focused REIT.  Our initial earnings target of 2.7 to 2.8 pence  per share has been achieved and in only six  months we have made material progress in  improving the quality of the portfolio so as to  deliver long‑term sustainable income returns  and enhanced growth prospects. Scalable business There are a number of long-term benefits  associated with greater scale, including greater  access to capital markets and liquidity, a lower  cost of capital, overhead efficiencies and  operational flexibility. However, these benefits  will remain secondary to securing the right  income focused investment opportunities for  our shareholders.  The acquisition of a further 32.8 per cent  stake in International
