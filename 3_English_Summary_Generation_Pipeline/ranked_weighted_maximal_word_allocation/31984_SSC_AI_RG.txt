Caroline  brings more than 20 years’  experience in the financial services  industry, most recently as Head of UK  Premier and Wealth at HSBC. She  joins the group at an exciting point in  its development. Our discretionary funds under  management grew substantially  during the year, surpassing the  significant milestone of £10bn in April  2017 and reaching £10.5bn as at  30 June 2017 (2016: £8.3bn), an  increase of 25.9%. This compares to a  10.5% increase in the FTSE UK Private  Investor Balanced Index and  represents a combination of  investment performance (14.5%) and  continued organic growth (11.5%). Underlying profit before tax for the  year was £18.4m (2016: £15.5m), an  increase of 18.6% on the previous  year, representing an underlying  profit margin of 20.1% (2016: 19.1%).  Underlying earnings per share also  increased by 31.7% to 115.76p (2016:  87 .92p). Statutory profit before tax for  the year fell by 49.3% to £8.0m (2016:  £15.9m), predominantly due to the  decision to deal proactively with  certain legacy matters arising from  the former Spearpoint business, as  explained in the Chief Executive’s  Review. We have announced the  sale of Braemar Estates, our  property management division,  which will enable us to focus on our  core businesses.  The board has recommended a final  dividend of 26.0p (2016: 23.0p) which,  subject to approval by shareholders,  will result in total dividends for the  year of 41.0p (2016: 35.0p). This  represents an increase of 17 .1% on the  previous year and reaffirms the  board’s confidence in the strength of  the business and our commitment  to a progressive dividend policy.  The final dividend will be paid on
