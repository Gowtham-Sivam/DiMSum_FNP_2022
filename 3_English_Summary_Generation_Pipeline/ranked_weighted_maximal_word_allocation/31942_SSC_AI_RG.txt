Revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior  year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the Board’s expectations.   Financial results and condition   Revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before  the IntelliSAW related license fee of £3.04m). Administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m  in the prior year. This increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and  marketing activity within Translogik to launch iTrack II and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with  a number of key customers for this system.    The pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m  and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net IntelliSAW licence fee of £1.17m.  The total  loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary  share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). The Board do not recommend payment of a  dividend (2016: Nil).  Net cash balances at 30 June 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m).   Strategy  The Group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two  principal businesses, SAWSense and Translogik.  The Group intends to continue to commercialise sensor technologies by working closely with global  partners in order to build value for shareholders through the generation and distribution of net income,  and/or the return of capital on realisation.  SAWSense designs and develops Surface Acoustic Wave (or “SAW”) sensor devices that can be used to  measure torque, pressure and/or temperature in harsh, restricted or demanding environments to very high  accuracy. This world leading technology has a broad range of potential uses ranging from premium value  custom applications through to high volume mass markets.  Translogik designs and markets a range of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems (“TPMS”), products and  services for heavy duty off road vehicles (particularly mine-haul trucks), commercial truck and bus as well  as 8  Chief Executive’s report    Towards the latter part of this breakthrough year, the Group has commenced generating commercial  revenues from products and services that are well placed to offer unique solutions over a sustained period  of competitive advantage in the future.      SAWSense  SAWSense is a leader in the development of Surface Acoustic Wave ("SAW") wireless, battery-less,  sensor systems that offer significant advantages over legacy systems in common use. The business  continues to be involved in several live projects in conjunction with major global industrial companies. In  the short to medium term, the primary source of ongoing revenue is dependent upon the level of customer  chargeable engineering activity and royalties, which was £0.29m in 2017 (2016: £0.42m).  In the prior year, pilot production had commenced of sensor kits to measure temperature, vibration and  torque on a new range of industrial equipment recently launched by a large European OEM. Whilst the  technology continues to be under commercial evaluation, the customer has yet to determine how the  benefits it offers are to be monetised.  Accordingly, there can be no certainty of future income from this  source.   We continue to develop potential applications in other sectors, most notably automotive, although  commercialisation in these areas is not considered to be imminent.  In July 2016, SAWSense entered into a significant licensing agreement with GE for the use of our  patented, wireless, passive SAW technology in a certain specific torque application. The Group received  a non-refundable license fee of $0.50m on completion in July 2016, with a further $0.25m received in  March 2017 following successful technical validation. In addition to the fee, GE will pay to Transense a  perpetual sales royalty in respect of unit sales upon commercialisation, although this is not likely to arise  for several years. More recently the Group has been involved in discussions with a number of other  divisions within GE regarding further projects and the relationship between the Group and GE continues  to progress well.
