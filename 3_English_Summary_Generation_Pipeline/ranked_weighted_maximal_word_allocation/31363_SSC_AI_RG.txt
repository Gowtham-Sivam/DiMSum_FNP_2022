Following a positive litigation  ruling and the sale of our core  UK business, the Group repaid  £60 million of debt and returned  £75 million to shareholders, whilst  having sufficient cash to facilitate  immediate growth prospects  during the year.  Your Board has also undergone some change during  the year and I’m delighted to have welcomed Richard  Cooper and Giles Vardey, who bring leading gaming  and business experience, and Andrew Gaughan, now  CEO, to the PLC Board. These appointments bring  significant incremental expertise and skills to the  Group. The Board wishes to acknowledge Directors who  departed the Board in 2017: Roger Withers (who had  served as Chairman), Ian Penrose (Chief Executive)  and Mickey Kalifa (CFO).  In March 2017 the Group announced a conditional  agreement to sell the Football Pools business, which  was subsequently passed by shareholders in April  2017. The Football Pools represented the mainstay  of the Group’s EBITDA and in particular, the bulk of  the UK earnings stream. The sale completed in June  2017 and now the Group’s earnings are around 80%  denominated in USD, with GBP representing around  10%, Euro’s 8%, and CAD 2%. The Board anticipates  further growth in USD contributions going forward  and the Board will be evaluating whether the  reporting currency for the Group should become the  US dollar. The current Board recognises stakeholder concern  regarding previous investment venture returns  and a track record of impairing investments,  which unfortunately continued in 2017 as the book  valuations of various historic investments have yet  again had to be revalued downwards. Given an  absence of an investment strategy in early 2017, to  provide tangible growth opportunities, the Board  elected to return capital to shareholders thus de- risking investor capital. Indeed, the Group made two significant returns of  capital to shareholders during the year. This was the  first time in its recent history that capital has been  returned to shareholders. £21 million was returned  in March 2017 via a Tender Offer and, following a  required Court approved capital reduction, a further  £54 million was returned by way of a special dividend  in December 2017. 170749 Sportech Front end 27 April.indd   8 27/04/2018   20:30 9 Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Following the sale of the Football Pools and  significant capital returns to shareholders, it became  inevitable that having a UK-based executive  management team was not an appropriate structure  for the Group going forward. Following the  announced decisions by UK-based senior executives  to leave the now US-focused Group, a cost reduction  exercise commenced to streamline the UK cost base. I  am pleased to report that the Board has executed on  this plan and has reduced the UK corporate cost base  significantly going forward. At all times during this process, consent has been  sought, and been given, by the regulatory authorities  where change in management is a condition  precedent. The Group continues to enjoy excellent  relationships with these regulators. Formal Sale Process In October 2017, after a number of unsolicited  external approaches, the Board decided that it  would consider formal offers for the Group and  commenced a Formal Sale Process. The Board and  senior management invested considerable
