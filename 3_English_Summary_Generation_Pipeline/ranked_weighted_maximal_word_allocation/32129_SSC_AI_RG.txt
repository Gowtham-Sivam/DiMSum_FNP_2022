This provides us with exciting  opportunities for growth in a diverse  range of markets and with a strong  motivation to make a positive  difference to people’s lives worldwide. We have a clear growth strategy, a  simple financial model and a unique  organisational structure, which is  customer-focused and enables us  to adapt quickly to market changes. Halma has had a well-established  financial target that aims to double  our earnings every five years, without  becoming highly geared or seeking  further equity, provided there are  similar rates of organic, acquisitive and  dividend growth. This aspiration pushes  our businesses to deliver sustainable  revenue growth by increasing  investment in innovation, talent and  international expansion rather than  limiting their focus only on operational  efficiency and short-term profitability. Over the past five years, we have  achieved compound annual growth  rates of 10% for revenue and 11% for  profit with a good balance between  organic, acquisition and dividend  growth. This strong performance  reflects not only our sound growth  strategy but also the exceptional  commitment, abilities and dedication  of talented individuals in every part  of Halma. I thank all of them for their  contribution to this financial success  and, in the process, realising our  shared purpose and making a positive  difference to people’s lives worldwide. Record revenue and profit Halma performed strongly over the  past year, achieving its fourteenth  consecutive year of record revenue  and profit. Revenue increased by 19% to £962m  (2016: £808m) including 4% organic  constant currency growth and 10%  favourable currency impact. Adjusted 1   profit increased by 17% to £194m (2016:  £166m), also including 4% organic  constant currency growth and 10%  favourable currency impact. There were  52 weeks trading in this year compared  with 53 weeks trading last year. Returns were maintained at a high level  with Return on Sales of 20.2% (2016:  20.6%) well within our targeted range  of 18% to 22%. Return on Capital  Employed for our operating companies  remained high at 72% (2016: 72%).  The Group’s Return on Total Invested  Capital was 15.3% (2016: 15.6%). Cash generation and balance sheet  supports future growth Cash generation was good and we  ended the year with net debt of £196m  (2016: £247m) after spending £10m on  current year acquisitions (2016: £193m),  £24m on capital expenditure  (2016: £24m), £50m on dividends  to shareholders (2016: £47m), and  paying £33m of tax (2016: £27m). With gearing at the year end (net  debt to EBITDA) of 0.86 times (2016:  1.27 times), we have a strong balance  sheet which can support further  strategic investment. In November  2016, we increased and extended our  revolving credit facilities from £360m  until 2018 to £550m until 2021.
