For the rest   of my Review I want to look at the progress  we made towards our goals in 2012, as   well as consider some of the setbacks   we encountered. Scientiﬁc leadership In a research and development-based  business such as AstraZeneca, I believe  that everything starts with a focus   on patients and great science. It is our   ﬁrst priority. AstraZeneca has a unique combination   of scientiﬁc capabilities in small molecules,  biologics, immunotherapies and antibody  engineering. This puts us in a strong  position to develop the targeted novel  medicines and combinations (such as  drug-antibody conjugates) required to meet  patient needs in the future. Reviews that   we have held with scientiﬁc experts outside  AstraZeneca have further reinforced my  conﬁdence in our underlying science base. We have much to do to realise our full  scientiﬁc potential but made some progress  in 2012. On the regulatory front, we received  approvals in Europe for Zinforo, our  intravenous antibiotic, Caprelsa, our thyroid  cancer treatment, and Forxiga, a product   of our diabetes alliance with BMS. In the   US, FluMist Quadrivalent was approved,   the ﬁrst four-strain inﬂuenza vaccine   to be approved by the FDA. I am both excited and honoured to   have been asked to lead AstraZeneca.  Throughout my career I have had enormous  respect for its people and what they have  achieved. Since joining in October, I have  seen for myself the passion and commitment  that exists within the Group to improve the  lives of patients around the world.  This level of energy should come as no  surprise as our innovative medicines mean  that more people than ever before are   able to lead longer and healthier lives.   As we seek to show throughout this   Annual Report, successful pharmaceutical  innovation, delivered responsibly, adds   value not only for patients and shareholders  but also for healthcare systems and the  communities in which we work. The challenge Leif has already described in his Chairman’s  Statement how, in addition to the well-known  challenges that confront the pharmaceutical  sector, the loss of exclusivity of several   of our major brands largely deﬁned  AstraZeneca’s ﬁnancial performance in  2012. I believe that our ability to provide   an acceptable level of return to you in the  years ahead will come from an undiluted  focus on delivering great medicines to  patients through innovative science and  global
