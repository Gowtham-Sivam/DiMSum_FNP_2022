Circle has successfully realised a year-on-year  growth of 19.9% in NAV, delivering a final NAV  of 183p per share, as well as a proposed final  dividend of 2.6p per share, an increase of 8.3%,  to bring the annual dividend to 5p. This growth  has come almost entirely through the team’s  strong asset management and stock picking  capabilities, with asset-transforming capex  programmes at key sites including K2, Kents  Hill Park in Milton Keynes and 36 Great Charles  Street in Birmingham, which reached completion  in the period, as well as solid progress being  made at Somerset House in Birmingham’s CBD.  Circle’s high level of tenant retention is largely  attributable to both the high standards of  management that we demand within our  multi-let properties and our flexible approach  to tenant renewal negotiations. Our vacancy  rate in the standing investment portfolio is less  than 1% as, where appropriate, we continue to  place a greater emphasis upon the certainty of  secure income and the creation of longer leases  in preference to the maximisation of rents. It is the strength of Circle’s asset management  that differentiates the Company from its  peers. In order to achieve lettings in a highly  competitive market, it is essential to respond  swiftly to Chairman  3  Circle Property Plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Financials Governance Strategic Report Strategic Report Throughout the year we have continued  with our asset management programme and  have now assembled a core portfolio of high  quality regional offices in prime locations  which are primarily well let to high quality  tenants on medium or long-term leases. As a  result, and because of the resilient demand  for the type of space we offer, we believe our  portfolio will prove less susceptible to any  downward valuation shifts arising from any  prolonged political and economic uncertainty. Following the refinancing of our debt facility  with RBS, we are currently also reviewing our  hedging strategy, including the possibility of  entering into longer-term fixed rate funding. Our  interest cover is sufficient to cover any potential  or anticipated increased interest charges, but  we are aware that inflationary pressures are  growing as a result of the weaker pound.  It is therefore likely that income will continue  to feature as a prerequisite to attract  investors but, through continued strong stock  selection, appropriate portfolio recycling  and strong asset management, we aim to  provide a better total return over time, than  a purely income driven stock, as evidenced by  the 19.9% growth in EPRA NAV in the year  under review compared to a 3.9% total return  for the MSCI All Property index in 2016.  Most encouragingly, almost all of the increase  in NAV within the portfolio is attributable  to our asset management. By successfully  undertaking lease renegotiations, new lettings  and lease renewals we have maximised income  and have generated earnings per share of 35p. In Birmingham, we only recently in July launched  36 Great Charles Street into the letting market  and it has been very well received, The façade  has just been cleaned while the reception area  has been enlarged,
