They were named as recipients of the  awards in the New Year’s Honours List in  recognition of their services to business  and the community. Both were given their insignia by His  Royal Highness in front of their proud  families in the palace’s elegant ballroom.  “It was so nice to be there alongside so  many people who were being recognised  for their selfless actions, ordinary people  who give freely of their time and efforts  yet seek no reward.” Former chairman Bob Woods, now  Senior Adviser to the company, said:  “To be there, surrounded by so much  history, and to think we were a small  part of it was an incredible feeling and  something I’ll always cherish.” “It was an amazing occasion,  a real mixture of excitement  and adrenaline, but at  the same time incredibly  humbling” Ian Mattioli MBE Chief Executive Officer Mattioli Woods plc Annual Report 2017 14 We continue to be proactive in relation to  the opportunities this creates, with our  specialists dedicated to keeping up with  the pace of change. Our entrepreneurial  model allows us to adapt and advise our  clients accordingly.  Our markets are highly fragmented and  serviced by a wide range of suppliers  offering diverse services to both individual  and corporate clients. These markets  remain highly competitive, with recent  regulatory changes, including the abolition  of provider commissions on corporate  pensions in April 2016 and increased  capital requirements for SIPP operators  from 1 September 2016, driving further  consolidation across the industry.  The Financial Advice Market Review  (“FAMR”) published by the FCA and   HM Treasury in March 2016 made a series  of recommendations designed to tackle  barriers to consumers engaging with  financial advice and help the industry  develop more cost-effective ways of  delivering advice, particularly through the  use of technology, while the FCA’s recent  review of the asset management market  highlighted its concerns over pricing.  We continue to invest in the development  of our IT platform and anticipate that the  entry of new competitors with innovative  technology (such as ‘robo-advice’) may  drive some margin compression in the  wider market. I expect this, coupled with  regulatory and market concerns around  the cost of financial services, to further  validate our vertically-integrated model,  where seeking operational efficiencies in  administration and reducing investment  management and administration costs  are key elements of our drive to reduce  our clients’ TERs, while maintaining  fair and sustainable profit margins for  our shareholders.
