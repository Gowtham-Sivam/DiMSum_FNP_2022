 114 Section 172 statement  www.rotork.com  Rotork Annual Report 2022  01  Strategic report  Highlights  A strong set of results Rotork’s 2022 results were strong. Revenues increased 12.8% year-on-year, benefiting from higher selling price realisation and the second half’s strong recovery in deliveries. Adjusted operating margins recovered in the second half, however not sufficiently to fully offset the first half margin decline. In November we launched our Growth+ strategy which is designed to deliver on our ambition of mid to high single-digit revenue growth and mid-20s margins over time.

The Act specifically targets methane emissions and water management and conservation  We were ranked in the top 5% globally in the Machinery and Electrical Equipment industry by S&P in its highly regarded Corporate Sustainability Assessment  www.rotork.com  Our Chairman Martin Lamb announced Chief Executive Officer’s statement  I am extremely pleased to report a strong set of results  Kiet Huynh Chief Executive Officer  I am pleased to report a resumption of organic sales growth and a strong second half performance as expected. This was particularly encouraging given 2022’s highly challenging backdrop which included significant supply chain disruption and a resurgence in inflation. During my first year as Chief Executive I have invested significant time meeting key stakeholders – including our end users, trade partners, colleagues and investors. I would like to thank everyone for the warm reception I have received, it was great to spend time renewing acquaintances and making new contacts.  Health, safety & wellbeing The safety of our people, partners and visitors is our number one priority and our vision for health and safety is zero harm. In 2022 we recorded a lost-time injury rate of 0.13, an encouraging improvement on 2021’s 0.20, in part reflecting the roll-out of the ‘Rotork Life Saving Rules’. Our Total Recordable Injury Rate was 0.53 (2021: 0.56). A knock-on effect of the invasion of Ukraine and of economies emerging from the pandemic has been significant consumer price inflation, particularly of essentials such as energy and food. We responded to the ‘cost of living crisis’ by announcing an employee benefits review, the result of which included additional support for colleagues in more junior roles and bringing forward salary increases.  18 Rotork Annual Report 2022   We launched our first employee discount scheme (in the UK) and based upon its success we are looking to launch similar schemes in other countries. We also introduced electric-vehicle salary sacrifice schemes in several countries, helping colleagues to benefit from local financial incentives intending to accelerate the take-up of pure electric and hybrid vehicles. Rotork also provided short-term financial help to employees and ex-employees facing hardship through Rotork Benevolent Support. The scheme made more grants in 2022 than it did in 2021. We completed two employee engagement pulse surveys during the year, one in June and one in December. Participation was good in both, at 75%. The engagement survey asks employees to rate Rotork as a place to work between 1-10, where 10 is good. Engagement continues to improve, with the score increasing to 7.2 in December 2022, from 6.7 in June and 6.4 the year before. We believe that the effective communication of our Growth+ strategy and cost of living actions have helped to improve our scores. We have a committed workforce who are proud to be Rotork employees and determined to deliver on our ambitious goals. We offer our warmest thanks and appreciation for all their efforts throughout 2022.  www.rotork.com  Strategic report  Financial statements  Corporate governance  Growth+ strategy launch In November we presented our new Growth+ strategy at our Capital Markets Event held in London. The starting point of Growth+ is our Purpose, ‘keeping the world flowing for future generations’. Our Purpose is unchanged. It remains a powerful motivator, and it drives everything we do. It recognises the important part that we play in making our world a great place in which to live, but also the role we can
