Since that starting point 28 years  ago, the division has evolved  to provide a spectrum of highly  advanced technologically- driven products. These range  from recording equipment for  hobbyists all the way to audio  networking systems for large  organisations, such as NBC  and Microsoft. Importantly, the  Focusrite name has always  meant legendary, top-of-the- range sound quality. Through  product innovation we now offer  the best value to a wide range  of different market segments.  As a result, we’ve become  the number one producer of  audio interfaces in the world. Novation Novation, a brand well known for  synthesisers, was acquired by  Focusrite in 2004, Novation now  represents about a third of our  revenue. Making new instruments  and software for electronic  music, the fastest-growing music  creation segment, Novation is  disrupting how music is made  with its grid controllers, iOS  software and new approaches  to mobile music making. Chairman’s Statement Another  successful year I am very pleased to report that FY17 has proved to be another  successful year, exceeding our expectations for revenue, at  £66.1 million (+21.6%), profit and cash flow. The Company’s products have continued  to grow market share in our established  and growth markets. Revenue and profits  have been boosted by the strengthening  of the Euro and US Dollar but, even on  a constant currency basis, the Company  has enjoyed excellent growth. This is our first set of results with  Tim Carroll as Chief Executive Officer,  having joined the Company in January  2017. He has successfully established  himself with the management team  and the Company more broadly and  is building on Focusrite’s strong  foundations. Tim enjoyed almost 20 years  with Avid Technology Inc, a respected  business in our marketplace, in global  sales roles and latterly heading the  audio division, as a result of which he  has an unmatched experience of the  markets that Focusrite seeks to serve,  from the professional to amateur. FY17 has seen continued development  of our sales channels. I am particularly  pleased with the progress of our  e-commerce platform, only in its second  year and which is now offering the  Company’s products globally. Sales in  the Far East, notably China, continue to  grow faster than most other regions of  the world. In response to this demand,  the Company has established a Hong  Kong office to manage our third-party Chief Executive’s Statement A refined growth
