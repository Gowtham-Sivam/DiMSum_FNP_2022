This is the first full year statement following  the successful Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) on the Alternative  Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London Stock Exchange in  October 2016.  Van Elle’s equity story, which centred around the Company’s  leading position in the UK, its differentiated offering and attractive  end markets, supported by a strong financial profile, a well invested  platform and a strategy for growth, was well received by investors. Although we have only been a quoted company for a short time,  I believe that we have made much progress across the business  and confidence is high. It is thanks to the hard work put in by our  talented management team, as well as those working across and  with the business, that we could make this progress and create  the foundation from which to continue to grow our operation. Highlights I am pleased that in our maiden results as a quoted company  Van Elle has reported an 11.8% increase in revenue to £94.1m  (2016: £84.2m) and an underlying operating profit of £11.6m  (2016: £11.1m), representing a record year and continuing our  impressive year‑on‑year profitable growth. These results reflect our continuing strategic drive to focus on  growth markets, enabled by targeted investment in specialist rigs,  expansion of our precast concrete manufacturing capabilities and
