About  12p of this increase was due to the one‑off revaluation of US  deferred tax liabilities as a result of the recently enacted US tax  reforms. As previously announced, these changes are expected  to reduce the group’s future effective tax rate from a percentage  number in the mid-thirties to a number in the high-twenties,  resulting in an ongoing earnings per share enhancement of  between 5p and 10p per share each year. As a result, and reflecting confidence in the group’s prospects,  the Board has decided to rebase future dividends and accordingly  recommends a 20% increase in the 2017 full year dividend to  34.2p (2016: 28.5p). Full year 2017 dividend cover, before  non‑underlying items, is 3.0x (2016: 2.7x). This recommendation results in a proposed 2017 final dividend  of 24.5p per share (2016: 19.25p per share), a 27% increase, to be  paid on 22 June 2018 to shareholders on the register as at the  close of business on 1 June 2018.  The group intends to maintain a progressive dividend policy  in the future. Outlook Our group order book of over £1bn gives us confidence as we  start 2018. Most of our markets remain robust, bidding activity  is at a healthy level and Keller is well positioned to address the  market trends of urbanisation and infrastructure growth. Two  significant loss‑making contracts in APAC in 2017 masked some  good progress in the region and we continue to expect the  division to return to profit in 2018. Overall, despite the completion  of our excellent Caspian project, we expect 2018 to be another  year of underlying progress, albeit with recent currency  movements expected to result in translational headwinds  on reported profits. We are now seeing tangible results from a number of the  strategic initiatives launched in the last two years. We are  confident that a combination 14 Keller Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 We continue to make  progress on operational  productivity with our 5S  rollout in all business units. Leverage of group and divisional scale Our procurement capability continues to gain strength and  traction, with teams now established in each division. Significant  benefits from this investment are already being realised. We have  also created one global IT organisation. This pulls together our  efforts on infrastructure and applications, reducing the burden  on local teams as well as creating economies of scale. Enhancing engineering and operations Our Global Product Teams are helping us focus on R&D  opportunities, developing product strategies and continuing  to share best practice and innovations. We also continued to  make progress on operational productivity, with our 5S roll-out  implemented across Keller and starting to become part of the  cultural norm. We will continue to build our ‘lean’ capabilities  in 2018. We executed 6,300 projects throughout the world in 2017 . These  continue to set the standard in the industry and enhance Keller’s  strong reputation for providing innovative solutions, combined  with excellent execution focused on our customers’ needs.  Average project size is still comparatively small at £300k per  project. Local and smaller projects remain the foundation of  Keller, supported by our extensive branch network (around 180  locations) and our skilled local teams who know their markets  and customers well. We also had significant success in the large  project domain with many market-leading projects across all  regions. Most notably, the Caspian project has set the  benchmark internally for a very well-conceived and executed  effort in a challenging environment. The vast majority of our projects were executed well and,  between them, they generated around £370m of gross profit  in 2017. In APAC, however, where the difficult pricing and  contractual environment of the 2015/16 downturn left little  project contingency, we have underperformed our expectations  notably on two major Australian projects. Risk and opportunity  management remain an enduring focus area and we are confident  that lessons learned from all loss-making
