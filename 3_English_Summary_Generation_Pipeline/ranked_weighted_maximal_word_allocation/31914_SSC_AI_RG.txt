Acquisition of Danlind a/s On 4 September 2017, the Group announced the  proposed acquisition of the entire share capital of  Danlind a/s, a supplier of auto dishwash and laundry  products, based in Denmark. Danlind provides  McBride with access to accelerated growth in the key  strategic category of auto dishwash tablets, through  its well-invested capacity, technology platform and  high quality product range. Danlind has a significant  range of retail and contract customers along with a  well-established position in the Nordic region and in  the commercial laundry and dishwash markets. Danlind  will enable McBride to gain entry into growth segments  where it is currently under-represented. Additionally,  Danlind’s strong position in Ecolabel products can  be developed further through McBride’s extensive  European reach.  Danlind operates from three manufacturing sites in  Denmark, and has approximately 250 employees. For the  year ended 31 December 2016, Danlind reported revenues  of £58.4 million, EBITDA of £1.6 million, a loss before  tax of £1.3 million, and had gross assets of £48.0 million  as at 31 December 2016. For its financial year ending  31 December 2017, on a standalone basis, Danlind is  currently expected to generate c.£2.5 million of EBITDA.  McBride expects to realise significant commercial,  technical running in 2016 and 2017. 20 McBride plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Executive   review Supply chain and overhead  efficiency initiatives enabled by  the ‘Manufacturing our Future’  strategy underpinned our  financial results.

This time last year, the Group reported it had completed  the exercise to reduce the levels of complexity in  our customer and product portfolio (our “customer  choices” project), the impact of which would reduce  revenues on an annualised basis by approximately  £20.0 million. This initiative commenced in the second  half year of the previous financial year such that in the  twelve months to 30 June 2017, the project lowered  revenues by £16 million, equating to approximately  2.1% of the year-on-year reduction in Group sales  (at constant currency).  Excluding “customer choices”, overall volumes were  lower by a further 2.8% across the Group as some  of our markets became increasingly competitive.  The Group remained disciplined in its approach to  margin management ensuring its sales
