FOR MORE INFORMATION SEE PAGE 02 OVERVIEW TISSUE REGENIX GROUP PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS   FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017 01 Our Business  The Group has performed well against our strategic milestones for  the year. The acquisition of CellRight Technologies is a transformative  opportunity for the Group, combining two innovative, regenerative  platforms with large addressable markets and synergistic growth  opportunities. With the appointment of Steve Couldwell as CEO,  the Board is confident that it has the leadership in place to take  the Company to the next stage and a comprehensive review of the  development pipeline is ongoing. With our augmented, established  product portfolio generating a growing level of sales, we have  identified key development assets to focus our commercial resources  behind, and we are confident that following final product validation  and transfer of manufacturing in-house, the newly focused strategy  will drive significant shareholder returns.  Financial Performance  Overall Group performance  The Group delivered revenues of £5,233K in the 12 months to  31 December 2017, a 263% increase when compared to the  11 month period to December 2016.  Organic DermaPure ®  sales grew 46% in the US to £1,932K, and  the commercial traction of the European controlled joint venture  continued with increased revenues to £1,135K.  Following the equity fundraising undertaken in August 2017, the  Group has a robust cash position to fund the near term future of the  enlarged Group and we maintain our expectation that the Group will  be cash break-even during 2020.  Leadership  In November 2017, we announced the appointment of Steve  Couldwell as CEO of the Group. Steve succeeds Antony Odell who  stepped down in October 2017 after nine years leading the Group.  We would like to thank Antony for his leadership during the Group’s  early years. Steve has experience spanning over 25 years in the Medical  Device space and a proven track record of delivering revenue and  profit growth. He has had an extensive career including Smith &  Nephew and more recently, Sanofi BioSurgery based in Boston,  Massachusetts. Having held senior commercial positions in both  the US and Europe, Steve has the necessary skill set to drive the  next stages of the Group’s commercial strategy required to deliver  shareholder returns.  Following the resignation of Paul Devlin on 30 November, we   have appointed an  interim CFO and initiated a search for a  permanent candidate.  Our People  The Board and I would like to extend our thanks to our employees  and partners, especially throughout this year of significant change.  With the integration of CellRight Technologies, we welcomed a new  team in the US, led by CEO Jesus Hernandez, and the addition of  their experience and the ongoing commitment of all our employees  remain fundamental to our success.
