Strategic report Governance Financial statements ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 SAGA PLC 1 Strategic report Chairman’s statement Our focus on customer needs   has been the driving force behind   the growth of the business. They  remain at the heart of everything   we do. Evolution of the strategy and   further financial delivery leading   to enhanced shareholder returns I am delighted to present another strong  set of results. We have continued to deliver on our  progressive dividend policy this year,  increasing our dividend by 18.1% to 8.5p.  This equates to a payout ratio of 62% 1  of  net earnings, compared to 57% 2  in the  previous year. Last year, we increased  our target payout range from 40%-60%,  to 50%-70% as a sign of our confidence  that we will continue to deliver strong  financial performance. This year’s  decision to increase the dividend   again reflects the Board’s ongoing  confidence in the sustainability of our  dividend policy, which is supported by   a strong track record of profit growth  and cash generation through our   capital efficient model. Financially, we have again delivered  growth in underlying profit before tax   of 5.6% to £187.4m and basic earnings  per share by 6.0% to 14.1p.
