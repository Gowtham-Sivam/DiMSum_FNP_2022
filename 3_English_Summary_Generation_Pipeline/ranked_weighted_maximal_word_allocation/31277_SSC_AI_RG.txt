 Following the Company’ s 201 6 strategy review V elocys  identified the market for renewable fuels in the United States  as being particularly attractive for the commercialisation of its  technology .

Many governments have mandated driving  down greenhouse gas emissions by using  cleaner, renewable fuels – a move widely  supported by environmental agencies  and non-governmental organisations.  More are expected to follow suit. Industry  and consumers also want to drive  down their carbon footprint and reduce  emissions cost-effectively, and swiftly.

The airline industry (ICAO) has committed  to carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and  a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050.  Incremental operational efficiencies will  go a small way towards meeting these  targets but nothing less than a huge  increase in the supply of renewable  jet fuel will be needed if they are to  be met. By 2022 there is expected to  be a worldwide demand of more than  two billion gallons/yr of renewable jet  fuel based on carbon neutral growth,  of which more than 700m gallons per  year will be required in North America.  In the US, diesel consumption is around  40bn gallons/year with 25% growth  predicted by the EIA to 2040. There is an  urgent and increasing demand for
