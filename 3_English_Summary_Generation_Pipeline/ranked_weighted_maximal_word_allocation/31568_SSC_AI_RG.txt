The significant sales  momentum we have seen this year and the 609 software deals  we have signed - more CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT OVERVIEW Since the flotation of Blue Prism in March 2016 we have  seen significant progress in the RPA market and in our  business. There have been advances in the size and visibility   of the RPA market and it is clear that RPA as a  technology offering is now high on the agenda for   many organisations. The growing interest in the   market for RPA from new and existing participants   is testament to its increasing importance.  Blue Prism is both driving and benefiting from this  evolution of the market. In the period, we have seen   a significant increase in sales, a substantial growth of our  customer base and further strengthening of our market- leading position whilst managing the cost   base and cash flow with real discipline. The executive management has successfully executed the  strategy for growth set out at the time of the flotation.  Our principal route to market is through   our partner channel which is now highly engaged   and growing in sophistication and global reach and   has contributed enormously to our growth. THE BOARD The Board, which was formed just prior to flotation,   is functioning well and interacting effectively with the  executive management contributing a good balance of  skills and experience. Gary Johnson, our Chief Financial  Officer (“CFO”) at the time of flotation, has decided to  step down from the Board. Gary has made a significant  contribution over the past 3 years developing and  strengthening the financial systems to support our  expansion and growth. Ijoma Maluza has joined the  Board as CFO and will continue to build on the strong  platform established by Gary.  While businesses experiencing rapid growth, such as  Blue Prism, often face managerial challenges, the Board  is fully engaged with the executive management team  to ensure that the Group is positioned to address CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Upsells 264 Renewal rate EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY The Group set out a growth strategy at the time of its  IPO based on 4 strategic objectives. During the past   12 months we have continued to make meaningful  progress against each, as follows: BUILDING SCALABLE DEVELOPMENT, SALES   AND DELIVERY CHANNELS Blue Prism’s sales strategy is to achieve broad and scalable  sales growth through a global channel of distribution  partners. This partner sales channel includes a wide   range of highly engaged partners, comprising some of  the world’s largest consulting firms such as Accenture,   EY, IBM, KPMG, Deloitte and HCL as well as specialist  technology and digital transformation firms, such as  Thoughtonomy, DXC, RPAi, Symphony and Reveal Group.  All of the 324 new customers in FY2017 were sourced  through the channel for the first time (FY2016: 90 per  cent), including an increase in reseller deals. The Group launched a partner certification programme  during the period, designed to maintain the highest levels  of quality assurance in our sales and delivery model.   11 partners are now certified and, in March 2017, EY  became the first partner to achieve Gold status, followed  later in the year by Accenture. As interest in RPA  continues to increase, our focus remains to ensure the  Group is best equipped to service increasing demand by  maximising and optimising this partner distribution  channel. The Group has seen strong levels of industry recognition  and community support, as evidenced by the scale of  attendance and quality of sponsors at our Blue Prism  World events. Almost 2,000 customers and partners  attended events in San Francisco, New York, London,  Tokyo and Sydney. With premium sponsors including  Accenture, EY, Deloitte, KPMG, IBM, and Capgemini, we  go into 2018 with the confidence of having leading names  in the sectors we serve supporting our long-term vision. 100% Blue Prism Group plc ANNUAL REPORT
