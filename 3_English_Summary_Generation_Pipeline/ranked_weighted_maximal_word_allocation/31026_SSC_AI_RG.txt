Zotefoams plc Annual Report 2017 06 I am pleased to report a very successful year of  strong sales and earnings growth and significant  progress in the development of our business, with the  commissioning of our largest ever capital investment  project and the creation of an important strategic  partnership with Nike. 2017 performance Group sales grew 22% to £70.15m (2016: £57 .38m)   and profit before tax and exceptional item also grew  22% to £8.81m (2016: £7 .23m). Earnings per share  before exceptional item rose 17% from 13.69p to  16.04p. Profit before tax increased by 8% to £7 .55m  (2016: £6.99m) and earnings per share was up 3%   to 13.70p (2016: 13.25p).  All business segments reported strong sales growth  and our pipeline of commercial opportunities  developed positively throughout the year. We have  continued to invest in product and market development  as well as the governance structure to support an  increasingly international, high-growth business.  Investments The first phase of investment, HP1, at our site  in Kentucky, USA has now been successfully  commissioned, increasing Group high-pressure  autoclave capacity by over 20%. Further capacity  investment, this time in low-pressure autoclaves and  infrastructure, at a cost of £12m, was approved during  2017 for our Croydon, UK site, primarily for expansion  of our ZOTEK ®  range of HPP foams.  The Board has also assessed a number of additional  capacity options. It has decided, as a first step, to  proceed with the installation of a second high-pressure  autoclave (HP2) at our site in Kentucky at a cost of  some $9m, which also includes a supporting extrusion  line. The investment should deliver similar incremental  capacity to HP1 and is expected to be commissioned  in late 2019.  An introduction from our Chairman A very successful year We have a strong portfolio of  differentiated products and growth  opportunities and we will continue to  invest in capacity to enable these to  be delivered.  Earnings per share before  exceptional item 16.04p +17% 2016 13.69p Total dividend 5.93p +3.1% 2016 5.75p This is an exciting time for Zotefoams. We have a  strong portfolio of differentiated products and growth  opportunities and we will continue to invest in capacity  to enable these to be delivered.  Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 4.02p per  ordinary share (2016: 3.90p) which, if approved by  shareholders, would make a total of 5.93p per ordinary  share for the year (2016: 5.75p), an increase of 3.1%.  This reflects the Board’s continued confidence in the  Group’s future and is in line with the targeted policy of  paying a progressive dividend. If approved, the final  dividend will be paid on 24 May 2018 to shareholders  on the register on 20 April 2018.  Board changes and governance In August 2017 the Board appointed Doug Robertson
