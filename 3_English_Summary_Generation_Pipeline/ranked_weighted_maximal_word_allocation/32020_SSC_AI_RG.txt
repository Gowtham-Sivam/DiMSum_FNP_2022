CHAIRMAN’S FOREWORD ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 9 – CHAIRMAN’S FOREWORD Our business comprises two complementary streams and it  is pleasing that both have performed well over the course  of the year. Our manufacturing business focusses on the  development, formulation, and ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 – 12 – It has been a year of tremendous progress for the Group. Our  teams have worked extremely hard to maintain the positive  momentum in our manufacturing business and to successfully  integrate and accelerate the growth of the acquired The Brand  Architekts business. Within The Brand Architekts’ portfolio it is  pleasing to report that all major brands and major customers  are showing year on year growth and that the pace and quality  of new product launches have continued seamlessly. This is  a great credit to the team at Teddington who have proved  themselves to be as talented, professional and committed as  we had hoped at the time of acquisition. In the manufacturing business, our ability to support our  customer base with the innovation, quality and service  they require has enabled us to continue to grow sales and  contribution margins against strong prior year comparators  and the headwinds of significant raw material and packaging  inflation. Our reputation and relationship has been enhanced  across several key customers, both longstanding and new,   as we have successfully supported a number of critical  product launches for them which contributes to current  business performance and augurs well for future projects.
