WHO WE ARE

CUSTODIANS

We employ people with a dedicated passion,
expertise and energy. Without it, we couldn’t
do what we do.
As a unique consumer business, we strive
to attract people who possess a proud sense
of self-expression, share a united spirit and
who are true custodians of our brand.

I can give you hundreds of examples of how
our people use a custodian mindset every day
in order to drive the business forward.
The following few pages provide just a few
examples of what it means to be a brand
custodian, and recognise some of the teams
and individuals doing great work by living
our values every day.

STELLA MAKINWA

Our product strategy is
internally referred to as ‘icons
and innovation’ – we need to
continually invest and grow
our phenomenal icon products,
whilst innovating around this
core to bring freshness and
further grow brand heat.
ADAM MEEK
CHIEF PRODUCT OFFICER

KEEPING OUR BRAND ICONIC
Our design team understands
deeply our brand DNA and every
product we create is rooted in
the design handwriting of our
Originals. Our iconic 1460 boot,
1461 shoe and 2976 Chelsea boot
are at the centre of our product
architecture. To add buzz
each season, our design team
collaborates with a hand-picked
range of designers to develop
exceptional collaboration products.

OUR ‘CENTRE OF EXCELLENCE’
The first Dr. Martens boot was born on
1 April 1960 in our Cobbs Lane factory
in Wollaston, England. To this day, the
site remains home to our own Made In
England (‘MIE’) manufacturing facilities
which we use as our ‘centre of excellence’.
Some of the methods and techniques
used to make our boots and shoes
are unique to our brand, as are the
machines needed to complete them. The
manufacturing process is much the same
as it was over 60 years ago when the
very first Dr. Martens boot was produced.

‘TOUGH AS YOU’ CAMPAIGN
Working with world-class established mentors
such as Kojey Radical, Mahalia, Serious Klein
and Claire Laffut, our ‘Tough As You’
campaign works to provide opportunities and
exposure for under-represented creatives
through its mentorship programme. Our aim
is to provide the support and a platform for
grassroot talent to shine and shape the future
of music culture. During FY22 we also sought
to work with those who are already paving
the way for underrepresented talent, providing
them with grants to support their causes.
