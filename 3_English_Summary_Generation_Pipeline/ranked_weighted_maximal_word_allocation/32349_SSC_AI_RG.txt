Our strategy is designed to offer shareholders  a combination of income generation and value accretion.  Strategic focus Hull and East Yorkshire is core to the strategic direction  of KCOM, and receives the majority of the Group’s investment.  We are fully committed to completing the fibre deployment  across our market to deliver premium services both to homes  and businesses. This should deliver long-term sustainable cash  generation, to continue to support our dividend policy.  Our Enterprise business is focused on market areas, where we  have seen good growth and where we have market leading skills.  We are targeting development in this area to provide momentum  in shareholder value. A key part of our growth this year comes  from additional business from existing customers who recognise  the value we can add to their business. This helps to give us  confidence that our strategy is the right one. The Board expects,  over the coming 24 months to see further substantial progress,  in support of this strategy. Clear focus  on the future  Chairman’s statement Graham Holden  Non-Executive Chairman 07 KCOM Group PLC Annual report and accounts 2016/17 | Strategic report While we continue the investment in our fibre deployment  and the further development of our Enterprise business, I am  pleased to confirm that the Board is recommending, subject to  shareholder approval, a final dividend of 4.00 pence per share,  in accordance with our existing commitment to deliver a  minimum full year dividend of 6.00 pence per share for both this  year and the year ending 31 March 2018. This reflects both our  confidence in the strategy being executed by the management  team and longer term prospects. Board appointment In October, Jane Aikman joined the Board as Chief Financial  Officer. Jane previously held a number of Executive level  positions, including her most recent role as Chief Financial  Officer and Chief Operating Officer for Phoenix IT Group Plc  until its acquisition by and merger with Daisy Group. Jane has quickly established herself as a valued member of the  Board and her fresh perspectives are already bringing additional  strength and focus to the business. Jane will stand for election  by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in July. Board effectiveness We continually consider the effectiveness of the Board and have  a formal evaluation annually, which in 2016 was carried out by  our Company Secretary. The conclusion from the evaluation was  that we are operating effectively but there were some minor  areas for improvement. We continue to monitor against our set  of Board objectives which are detailed further in the Corporate  governance section. In 2017, we will conduct an externally  facilitated evaluation. “ We remain in an environment  of change and transition  both internally and for our  customers and markets.  Each presents new challenges  and exciting opportunities.” We seek always to ensure that we have appropriate succession  plans in place both for the Board and for the senior management  team of the business as well as recognising talent right across  the organisation. This has been a regular topic of discussion  during the year and is covered in the Nomination Committee  report on page 44.  Good governance and responsible business  Good governance is essential to the business and we seek  to adopt best practice where it is beneficial. In line with best practice, we have recently completed a  consultation with major shareholders around some proposed  changes to our Remuneration policy. I am pleased to say that  they received widespread support and the policy will be  presented to shareholders for approval at the AGM. As a major business headquartered in Hull, we are delighted to  be a Principal Partner for Hull’s 2017 City of Culture celebration.  This 12 month programme is designed to bring a wide variety  of cultural and artistic events to the city and provide a range  of opportunities for the local community to experience the  positive impact that this will bring. As well as supporting the  events themselves, the business is supporting a number of our  employees who are volunteering as City of Culture ambassadors. We hope that the legacy left by the City of Culture programme  will support the continued regeneration of the region for many  years
