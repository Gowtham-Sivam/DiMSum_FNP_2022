Sales of regional assets  since the year end have increased this  London weighting further to 66%. In the  investment portfolio we have created  buildings which reflect the needs of our  tenants, acknowledging that modern  lifestyles increasingly merge work and  leisure needs. We now have a portfolio of  multi-let, flexible and desirable properties  which also provide ongoing asset  management opportunities to add  value. Our London portfolio remains  reversionary with further value to be  created through the completion of our  redevelopment and refurbishment  programme, letting vacant space and  upcoming rent reviews. We believe that London will continue  to outperform the rest of the UK over  the medium and long term and our  strategy is to continue to increase our  London holdings. RESULTS FOR THE YEAR The profit before tax for the year to  31 March 2017 was Â£41.6m (2016: Â£114.0m).  Total Property Return reduced to Â£79.9m  (2016: Â£164.6m) and included growing net  rents of Â£47.0m, an increase of 8.3% on  2016 (Â£43.4m), and development losses  of Â£5.7m (2016: profit of Â£27.5m) after  deducting provisions of Â£12.8m  (2016: Â£6.4m). The gain on sale and  revaluation of the investment portfolio  contributed Â£38.6m (2016: Â£93.7m). Net finance costs of Â£21.2m were lower  than in 2016 (Â£22.6m) and the Income  Statement benefited from the shortening  of the maturity period for the Groupâ€™s  remaining interest rate swaps which led to  a Â£0.8m credit (2016: charge of Â£6.9m)  arising from the valuation of the Companyâ€™s  derivative financial instruments. The  revaluation of the Companyâ€™s Convertible  Bond provided a credit of Â£3.0m  (2016: Â£0.5m). Recurring administration  costs were marginally higher at Â£10.8m  (2016: Â£10.7m). Performance related  awards were substantially lower at Â£6.9m  (2016: Â£13.3m) with National Insurance  on these awards of Â£0.7m (2016: Â£2.1m). These results allow the Board to continue  its progressive dividend policy and to  recommend to Shareholders a final  dividend of 6.20p which, together with  the interim dividend of 2.40p paid in  December 2016, takes the total dividend  for the year to 8.60p (2016: 8.17p),  an overall increase of 5.3%. PERFORMANCE We measure our performance at both  portfolio and Company level, seeking  to outperform the relevant sector indices  and our peer group in the medium and  long term. EPRA earnings per
