 02 LondonMetric Property Plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic report Governance Financial statements We will continue to build the  foundations for future dividend  progression. Chairman’s statement Whilst political and economic  uncertainty was a signiﬁcant distraction  for the markets in the year, the attraction  of secure income continued to grow.  Not only are we living in a low growth,  low interest rate environment but ageing  demographics are accentuating the  search for income and alternatives  to low yielding government bonds.  This need has already risen substantially  and will grow further in the years  to come. High quality companies  offering well-covered and growing  dividends ought to become ever  more highly prized. Our signiﬁcant and increasing  investment in distribution is delivering  excellent returns, sustainable income  growth and long term value for our  shareholders. The sector is beneﬁting  strongly from structural support as  UK consumers continue to migrate  to online. Conversely, physical retail  continues to face signiﬁcant challenges  from this online shift with the inevitable  space overcapacity this brings to the  retail market.  This ongoing structural demand for  distribution and lack of meaningful  supply has given us the conﬁdence  to increase our investment across  all distribution sub-sectors of mega  box, regional and urban logistics.

This demonstrates not only the  attractive dynamics of our buildings but  increasingly the growing importance  that occupiers are putting on logistics  and fulﬁlment. Structural changes impacting  shopping habits and  occupier demand Technology is disrupting many long  established industries and real estate  is no exception. Structural trends in consumer behaviour  and shopping patterns continue to  drive retail sales online leading to c.10%  per annum online growth.  Retailers are therefore increasingly  committing more of their capital  expenditure into improving the  efficiencies of their fulﬁlment  operation with more investment in  digital infrastructure and distribution  warehousing.
