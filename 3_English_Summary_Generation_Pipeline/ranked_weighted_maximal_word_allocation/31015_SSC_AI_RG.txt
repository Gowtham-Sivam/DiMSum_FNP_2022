A great deal has been  achieved in the past four years in transitioning  Centaur Media into a more focused B2B  information group. I am looking forward  to working with the Board and supporting  the broader management team to take  advantage of the opportunities ahead.  All businesses are facing challenges driven  by the constantly evolving digital backdrop  and the increasing competition for attention  and performance. Centaur is successfully  managing its own adaption to this changing  landscape by reducing its exposure to print  advertising and growing its higher quality  digital recurring revenues.  The Group has invested in building an  outstanding portfolio of business intelligence  products that helps its clients by providing  valuable information, analytics and insight,  allowing them to maximise the value of this  through advisory services, media channels  and events to help connect with their  customers.  In the relatively short period that I have   been Chairman, my time has been spent  learning about the business, the market  dynamics and the opportunities ahead.

This is despite the continued decline  in advertising revenues which has been  compensated for by our expansion into  capability services through the acquisition   of MarketMakers. Including the results of the Home Interest  Segment to the date of disposal, our  adjusted operating profit² was £6.6m, down  from £9.1m in 2016 with revenue remaining  flat at £72.6m (2016: £72.5m). Following our strategic decision to dispose  of our last B2C segment, Home Interest, we  recorded a £20.9m profit on disposal of this  area of our business. This drove a
