We have continued to deliver good like-for -like sales growth in our existing business, as  well as a significant increase in net contract gains, which are strengthening our presence  across the world. Allied to this, our strategic initiatives have delivered further operational  improvements and margin growth. We announced a number of important contract wins in the year, further extending our  presence in North America and in the Rest of the World, where there are significant  structural growth opportunities. Additionally, this year we have entered the Indian market  through a joint venture, and the initial performance of this business has been encouraging.  In 2017 we increased our 3 Overview The Group delivered a good performance in the year, driven by like-for -like sales growth, new  contract openings across the world and the ongoing implementation of our programme of  operational improvements. We are continuing to invest in the development of the business  and to bring new brands and concepts to our clients and customers. We have made further  good progress in the development of the business in North America and Asia Pacific, and the  first year‚Äôs performance of our joint venture in India has been encouraging.  Strong financial results The financial performance of the Group is presented on an underlying basis, for which the  statutory reported results are adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange, the amortisation  of intangible assets created on the acquisition of the SSP business in 2006 and the revaluation  of the obligation to acquire an additional share of TFS by the end of the 2018 calendar year .  The statutory reported performance of the Group is explained in the financial review, with  detailed reconciliation between statutory and underlying performance provided on page 15. The Group delivered a strong financial performance in 2017 , with underlying operating profit  increasing by 27 .0% (on a constant currency basis) to ¬£162.9m, and with a constant currency  increase, excluding TFS, in the operating margin of 50 bps. The consolidation of TFS added a  further 30 bps, bringing the Group margin to 6.8%.  T otal revenue increased by 11.7% on a constant currency basis, including like-for -like  sales growth of 3.1%, net contract gains of 6.0% and a negative impact of 0.3% from the  additional leap year day in 2016. The TFS business contributed a further 2.9% to revenue.  Like-for -like growth in the air sector has again been stronger than the rail sector, driven by  increasing passenger numbers in most of our markets.  Net contract gains were 6.0% in the year , an encouraging increase from last year‚Äôs gains  of 1.7%. We saw very strong contributions from North America and the Rest of the World,  reporting net gains of c.23% and c.18% respectively. Significant new openings at Chicago  Midway and JFK T7 airports in North America, and in Hong Kong and China in the Rest of the  World, have contributed to this strong performance. We are encouraged by the pipeline of new contracts. During the year we won a number of  significant new contracts, including at airports in Seattle, Los Angeles and Boston in North  America, and at Cebu in the Philippines.  The strong operating margin improvement of 50 bps reflects the like-for -like sales growth  and further encouraging progress on our strategic initiatives.  We delivered strong free cash flow of ¬£89.0m, after investing ¬£115.0m in capital
