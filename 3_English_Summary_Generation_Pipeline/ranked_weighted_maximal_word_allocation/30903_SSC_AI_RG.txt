We have improved store profitability and have also   made progress in the development of our online channel  although there is still considerable work to do. Our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we  can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our  store network. The opportunity to build on this concept for our  core services is clear and will be a key part of our future strategy.  These activities have repositioned the business within the wider  alternative credit market and allowed the Group to access   a broader customer base. The Board ensures that this growth   is carefully managed with a clear focus on the changing risks,  both regulatory and financial, that this diversification brings. The growth in retail, FX and buyback also provide a degree   of resilience to changes in the marketplace.  Financial performance  The Group delivered profit after tax of £11.3m (2016: £7.6m) and  diluted earnings per share of 30.94 pence (2016: 20.88 pence).  Subject to shareholder approval, a final dividend of 6.2 pence  per ordinary share (2016: 5.3 pence) will be paid on 1 June 2018   to those shareholders on the register at the close of business   on 4 May 2018. This will bring the full year dividend to 10.5  pence per ordinary share (2016: 9.2 pence). The Group’s financial position is strong with growth in the  combined personal loan and pawnbroking loan books (net) to  £63.8m (31 December 2016: £50.2m). As a result net debt increased  to £13.3m at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: £5.4m).  At year end the Group had available headroom of £8.0m on its  £30m borrowing facilities. I am pleased to report that in March  2018 the facility was increased by £5.0m. Regulation H&T is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct  Authority (FCA) for all consumer credit business. During the  more traditional unsecured loan product.  08 | www.handt.co.uk Chief executive’s review The Group delivered profit before tax of £14.1m (2016: £9.7m)   as a result of improved gross profits in the key segments of  pawnbroking, retail and personal loans.  THE MARKET Our marketplace has undergone significant changes in the past  four years, experiencing peak competition, a falling gold price  and new regulation causing a number of our competitors to  restructure their businesses or exit the market. In comparison,  during 2017 we experienced far more stability allowing us to  focus on developing our proposition. OUR STRATEGY Our Vision:  H& T will be the premier provider   of alternative credit in the UK through   a range of services that help our customers   rebuild their credit rating and return   to the mainstream. The Group’s strategy is to serve a customer base whose access  to mainstream credit is limited and for whom small-sum loans  can help to address short-term financial challenges. The Group  will continue to deliver this strategy by developing a range   of lending products, both secured and unsecured, offered   in store and online. In expanding our credit products we aim   to genuinely help our customers and have updated our vision  statement to reinforce that vital message within the business. The development of a diversified suite of services including  retail, buyback and FX, improves returns and reduces the Group’s  exposure to gold price volatility. We continue to innovate and explore how to interact most  effectively with our customers through the development   of introducer channels, our online capability and our brand.   This development is supported by our stores that provides   our online customer with the opportunity to speak to a trained  member of staff face to face or to collect an item that they  reserved online.
