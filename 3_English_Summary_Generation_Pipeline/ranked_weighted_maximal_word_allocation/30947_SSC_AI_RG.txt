We are still focusing on  organic growth whether through our  ambitious brownfield exploration  programme at our current mines or  through greenfield prospects spread  across the Americas. We made solid progress in 2017 with our  brownfield aims – undertaking mapping  and geophysics studies, securing surface  drilling permits from the Peruvian  government and subsequently starting  our drilling campaigns at Arcata,  Inmaculada and San Jose. Safety and environment As mentioned in my statement last year, an  accident at the Inmaculada mine early in 2017  resulted in two fatalities. With great regret, we  disclosed that a second accident occurred at the  Arcata mine in July 2017 which also claimed the  lives of two colleagues. On behalf of the Board,  I would like to again convey our deepest  condolences to the families of the victims  involved. Our resolve to make Hochschild Mining  a safe place to work is as strong as ever and  management has responded by instigating a  wide-ranging programme to reinforce our safety  culture which: includes senior management  reviewing all high-risk activities; involves even  more frequent training; focuses on initiatives  to motivate and incentivise safe working; and  implements the most up-to-date safety risk  management information systems. Over the  course of a mine’s life, geological conditions   and mining methods may change but our  commitment to safety remains constant and   is one of our values which we are not willing  to compromise. Our focus on environmental Hochschild Mining plc 16 which we will be testing in 2018. Finally, at Arcata  we were able to discover additional inferred  resources and throughout 2018, an intensive  campaign will continue to explore for resources  with the goal of utilising the plant’s significant  spare capacity. Financial position Strong cash flow from our operations   combined with some balance sheet management  opportunities has left us in a healthy financial  position. On 23 January 2018, we were able to  redeem the remaining $295 million of our 7.75%  Senior Notes. We replaced a portion of these  bonds with short to medium term debt from  local banks in Peru with an average rate of 2.2%  and approximately $100 million was repaid from  existing cash resources. Consequently, our cash  balance after this transaction remains a healthy  $85 million and we expect our interest costs to  fall by approximately $20 million per year from   2019 onwards. Financial results Whilst an increased average gold price received  was offset by a moderate fall in the silver price  received, record production once again ensured a  rise in revenue of 5% to $723 million (2016: $688  million). The operational all-in sustaining cost of  $12.3 per silver equivalent ounce (2016: $11.2  per ounce) was in line with forecasts although  the increase reflected an increased investment in  brownfield exploration as well as one-off project  costs at Inmaculada and consequently this  resulted in Adjusted EBITDA of $301 million  (2016: $329 million). Finally, with finance costs  reduced despite the high yield bonds (now  repaid), basic earnings per share and adjusted  earnings per share was $0.08 per share (2016:  $0.11 and $0.09 per share respectively).  Outlook We expect attributable production in 2018 to   be 514,000 gold equivalent ounces (38 million  silver equivalent ounces) driven by another  240,000 gold equivalent ounces from  Inmaculada, an increased contribution of  9.5 million
