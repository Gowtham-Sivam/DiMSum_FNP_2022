 10 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017      A strong 2017  2017 was a good year for Rath bones and we produced some  robust financial results. The executive team responded well to  developments in a rapidly changing wealth management market,  and our investment managers achieved good risk-adjusted  returns for our clients in a time of great uncertainty and  persistently low interest rates.   UK and global investment markets performed well in 2017, with  some indices reaching record levels towards the end of the year.  This outcome has been positive for both Rathbones and our  clients, with the WMA Balanced Index up 7.2% in the year and   our funds under management reaching £39.1 billion, up 14.3% in  the year.   Profit before tax for 2017 increased 17.6% to £58.9 million after  incurring the costs associated with the relocation of our London  office and in pursuing strategic opportunities. These costs were  partially offset by a plan amendment gain arising from the closure  of our defined benefit pension schemes. Accordingly, basic  earnings per share of 92.7p in creased 17.5% from the 78.9p  reported last year. A full analysis of all non-underlying items  impacting profit before tax can be found on page 127.  Underlying profit before tax was £87.5 million for the year ended   31 December 2017, up 16.8% from the previous year, and we have  continued to balance our need to continue strategic expenditure  with maintaining good profitability, reporting an underlying profit  margin of 30.6% (2016: 29.8%) for the year. Underlying earnings per  share of 138.8p for 2017, increase d 13.7% from 122.1p last year.   In line with our progressive dividend policy, the board is  recommending a final dividend of 39.0p per share. This brings the  total dividend for the year to 61.0p per share, an increase of 7.0%  over last year.   We continually monitor opportunities to grow the business  through smaller acquisitions, but during the year we discussed  with an industry peer, Smith & Williamson, the benefits of  combining our businesses. The benefits to both parties and our  respective clients could have been considerable, but, following  extensive discussions, we were unable to conclude a transaction  that was in the best interests of both parties. Nevertheless,   I believe that our measured approach to this opportunity served  us well. We will continue to apply this discipline when we pursue  other opportunities.   Continued momentum   In 2014, we set out a five-year strategy which had the ambition to  reach £40 billion of funds under management by the end of 2018.  Accepting that investment market s have been favourable, we are  now well within sight of that goal with many of our strategic  initiatives continuing to 12 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2017      The wealth management sector   remains robust  The wealth management industry continues to be an exciting   and rapidly changing place to do business. In 2017, the industry   has not only had to navigate a particularly uncertain political  climate, but has also had to respond to a considerable amount   of new regulation.   Importantly, many positive drivers for long-term private wealth  accumulation are still in place. The challenge the current climate  brings is to secure the scale economies and operational efficiencies  necessary to respond positively to demographic changes and  technological advances, whilst reacting to a climate of increasing  price pressure.   In this respect, Rathbones contin ues to be well positioned in   the industry with our own funds under management reaching  £39.1 billion at 31 December 2017, up 14.3% from £34.2 billion at the  end of 2016. Total funds under management in our Investment  Management business at 31 December 2017 were £33.8 billion, up  11.9% from £30.2 billion in 2016, whilst our Unit Trusts business  reached a milestone of £5.3 billion, up 32.5% from last year.   Strong financial performance underpinned  by a 30% operating margin  Despite investing in a number of areas across the business during  the year, we maintained a leading operating margin of 30.6%   (2016: 29.8%) through a combination of relatively supportive  investment markets and continued net funds growth and cost  discipline. Underlying profit before tax totalled £87.5 million   (2016: £74.9 million), generating an underlying earnings per share  of 138.8p, an increase of 13 .7% from 122.1p in 2016.   In 2017, the group added £4.8 billion gross funds under  management organically, split between £3.1 billion in our  Investment Management business and £1.7 billion in our Unit  Trusts business (2016: £2.3 billion and £1.3 billion respectively).  Outflows from intergenerational wealth transfer, property  purchases and other uses of funds to support lifestyle continue  unabated in this low interest rate environment. Net organic  growth in this business was 3.0% (2016: 2.9%), which represents a  satisfactory result in an investment climate that was largely  directionless until the end of the year. Net flows into our Unit  Trusts business were very strong however, totalling £883 million  in the year (2016: £554 million) and helping its total funds under  management to reach a record £5.3 billion (2016: £4.0 billion)   at 31 December 2017.   Profit before tax for the year of £58.9 million was 17.6% higher than  the £50.1 million in 2016 and reflects the impact of a number of  non-underlying items. A full analysis of these items can be found  on page 31.  As reported on page 116, our balance sheet remains stable with a  consolidated
