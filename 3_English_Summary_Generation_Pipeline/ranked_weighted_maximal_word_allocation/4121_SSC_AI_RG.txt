combination with Countryside."
Ralph Findlay OBE | Chair

This is my first Chair letter since succeeding Ian Tyler as Chair
of the Group at our Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 18 May
2022. Having been a Non-Executive Director of the Group since
April 2015, I was delighted to have the opportunity to take on
this role.

Following its launch in 2021, we are continuing to progress our
sustainability strategy. Some of the homes we provide already
exceed the Future Homes Standard requirements and we are
applying our experience to develop innovative technical solutions
that drive even greater energy efficiency and carbon reduction.
