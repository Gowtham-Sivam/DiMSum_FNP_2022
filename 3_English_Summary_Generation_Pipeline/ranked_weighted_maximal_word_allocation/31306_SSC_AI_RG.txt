The CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT I am pleased to introduce the 2017 Annual Report and  Financial Statements. During 2017, the Group has made very  promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV  and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine,  with significant improvements in production rates, leading to   a much improved financial performance.  At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was  reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June  2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling  and completion techniques developed as a result of recent  studies, was completed successfully and put on production,  and in August 2017, following completion of its workover,  the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these  successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL  and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to  produce consistently during the year. With the improved  contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV  fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields  was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an  aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at  the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65%  over the year. The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues  to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth  and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange  rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately.  Nevertheless, there continue to be stresses in the economy  and weaknesses in the Ukrainian banking sector. The Ukrainian Government has implemented a number of  reforms in the oil and gas industry in recent years, which  include the deregulation of the gas supply market in late 2015,  and more recently, reductions in the subsoil tax rates relating  to oil and gas production and a proposed simplification of the  regulatory procedures applicable to oil and gas CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S STATEMENT Introduction The Group has made good progress at its Ukrainian fields  during 2017, with the increase in development activity at the  MEX-GOL and SV fields resulting in the successes of the  MEX-109 well, which came on production in June 2017, and  the SV-2 well, which came on production in August 2017,  providing a significant boost to production rates. During the year, the Group continued its work on the  subsurface of the MEX-GOL and SV fields, utilising the results  of P .D.F. Limited’s comprehensive re-evaluation study to plan  additional development of these fields. This work included  detailed reprocessing of the existing 3D seismic data, using  the latest processing technology, with the reprocessed  data now under interpretation. As well as the drilling of the  MEX-109 well and the workover of the SV-2 well, the Group  undertook workover operations on the GOL-2 and SV-6  wells during the year to eliminate water ingress into the wells,  but these operations were not successful and the Group is  currently considering further remedial work on these wells.  The Group also installed additional compression equipment,  upgraded the gas processing facilities and pipeline network,  and undertook remedial work on existing wells. At the VAS field, planning took place for the acquisition of new  3D seismic over the field and the drilling of the VAS-10 well,  both of which activities commenced in early 2018. Health, Safety, Environment and Security  (“HSES”) The Group is committed to maintaining the highest HSES  standards and the effective management of these areas is an  intrinsic element of the overall business ethos. Through strict  enforcement of the Group’s HSES Management System,  together with regular management meetings, training and the  appointment of dedicated safety professionals, the Group  strives to ensure that the impact of its business activities  on its staff, contractors and
