JLT has delivered a strong set of  financial results in 2017. The Group  made substantial financial progress,  returning to strong overall organic  revenue growth of 5%. During the year we carried out a  re-examination of the Group’s strategy,  and we have made some important  decisions which we believe will position  the Group for continued success. PERFORMANCE Total revenues increased by 10%,  or 6% at constant rates of exchange  (CRE), to £1.39 billion. The Group’s underlying trading profit  increased by 10% to £213.7 million  and by 7% at CRE. Underlying profit  before tax increased by 11% to  £191.5 million. The Group's trading  margin was maintained at 15.4%. Our reported profit before tax   increased by 35% to £181.6 million,  which includes the impact of net  exceptional items of £9.9 million. Reported diluted EPS increased to  54.7p and underlying diluted EPS  increased to 58.5p. INCREASED DIVIDEND The Directors have recommended  a final dividend of 21.8 pence per share  (2016: 20.6 pence) for the year to   31 December 2017. The dividend will be  paid on 8 May 2018 to shareholders who  are on the register as at 3 April 2018. This will bring the total dividend for   the year to 34.0 pence per share,   an overall increase of 5.6% and the   ninth consecutive year that JLT has   paid an increased dividend. The business has delivered a Total  Shareholder Return (TSR) of 328%  over the past nine years, as illustrated  in the chart on page 87. CORPORATE ACTIVITY  HIGHLIGHTS Our Risk & Insurance businesses  delivered organic revenue growth of  5% in the year, with strong client retention  and new business in JLT Europe delivering  good performances from most divisions in  challenging market conditions.  The build-out of our US Specialty  platform continues, with revenues  approaching USD 100 million in 2017.  pages 14 to 17 and in the Reviewing & Delivering Our Strategy  section on pages 22 to 24. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Board continues to recognise the need for a strong  corporate governance framework and supporting processes  across the Group and believes that good governance, with  tone set from the top, is a key factor in delivering sustainable  business performance and creating value for the Group's  stakeholders. The Board feels that it has a good balance of  experience, skills and knowledge to support and challenge  the management team, and that it is supported by effective  governance and control systems. More information on these  systems can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on  pages 57 to 66. In addition, the Directors’ Report on pages 91  to 98 reports on JLT’s compliance with the 2016 UK Corporate  Governance Code (the Code) during 2017. During the year, the Board and its Committees undertook  reviews of their effectiveness. The conclusions from these  reviews provided useful feedback to each body on its  performance. Further details are provided in the Corporate  Governance Report on pages 57 to 66.  JLT’s share incentive schemes are designed to ensure that  decisions are made by management to support long-term  growth, that the right behaviours are rewarded and that  management’s interests are aligned with those of shareholders.  Further details of the operation of these schemes can be found  in the Directors' Remuneration Report set out on pages 78 to 90. The strength and support of Jardine Matheson has been, and  will continue to be, an important factor in the success of JLT.  Since 2014 a Relationship Agreement has been in place with  Jardine Matheson, in accordance with the Listing Rules of the  Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which require shareholders  with a 30% or more shareholding to comply with certain  independence provisions set out in a written and legally  binding agreement. More detail on the relationship with  Jardine Matheson is set out on page 66. BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT  DEVELOPMENTS There were a number of Board and senior management  changes during 2017.
