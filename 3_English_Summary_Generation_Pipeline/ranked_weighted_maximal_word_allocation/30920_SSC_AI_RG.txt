We also  completed a successful transition of  Chief Executive, with the appointment  of Patrick André to the role as part of  a planned succession process. Global  steel production growth exceeded our  expectations and pleasingly our overall  sales growth outperformed the global  steel market. We also experienced  positive momentum in the majority of  foundry end markets. Overall, despite  experiencing headwinds relating to  signiﬁ cant raw material price increases  and some temporary increased  inter-company sourcing costs, the Group  saw a 24.2% increase in reported trading  proﬁ t (16. 1% on an underlying basis),  and a 20.2% increase in reported  revenue (12.5% on an underlying basis),  with cash generation strengthening  further. The Group continued to make  good progress with the restructuring  programme and we remained focused  on the delivery of our strategy and its  execution priorities. Finally, in December,  we strengthened our balance sheet,  repaying existing borrowing with the  issuance of debt in the US Private  Placement market.  New Chief Executive  The appointment of our new Chief  Executive, Our Performance 18 Vesuvius plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 7 Chief Executive’s Strategic Review Introduction  It is an honour to have been selected to  lead Vesuvius and I am grateful to our  Chairman, John McDonough, and the  Board of Directors for their trust. I would also like to thank François  Wanecq for his exceptional commitment  in leading Vesuvius over the past 1 2 years.  Thanks to his achievements and the  efforts of all our teams, the foundations  of the Group are strong and sound.  Our main objective is now to build on  these foundations and to generate  and accelerate the Group’s profitable  growth over the coming years. The strong performance of the Group  in 2017 is an important first step in the  implementation of this growth strategy. Strong Performance In a globally favourable economic  environment, both our Steel and Foundry  Divisions succeeded in outperforming  the general market growth. This was  particularly the case in China. Thanks to this performance, Vesuvius’  global sales in 2017 reached £1,683.9m,  an increase of 20.2% over 2016 on a  reported basis. At constant currency,  and adjusted for the effect of acquisitions,  underlying revenue was up 12.5% as  compared with 2016.  Our trading profit in 2017 reached  £165.5m, an increase of 24.2% over 2016  on a reported basis and 16. 1% on an  underlying basis. Our return on sales  improved from 9.5%
