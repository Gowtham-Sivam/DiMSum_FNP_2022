Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR STRATEGIC REPORT  OUR BUSINESS 01 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4 CHAIRMAN’S   STATEMENT 2017 was a transformational year for Animalcare  Group plc. Whilst characterised by continued  organic growth, the most dominant factor during  the year was the reverse acquisition of Ecuphar  NV (“Ecuphar”). The transaction completed  on 13 th  July 2017 and our statutory results for  the year ended December 2017 reflect a full  12 months contribution from Ecuphar and five  and a half months of Animalcare Group plc  (“Animalcare”), as previously constituted. 2016  comparatives are only for the Ecuphar business.  Financial Trading Group revenue increased by 22.4% to £83.7m  (2016: £68.4m) with 11.3% organic growth  within the Ecuphar business which contributed  £76.1m to overall Group revenues and  £7.6m from the original Animalcare business.  Underlying EBITDA (which excludes fair value  adjustments on acquired inventory, amortisation  of acquired intangibles and acquisition and  integration costs) increased by 11.9% to £10.0m  (2016: £8.9m) with £1.6m contributed by the  Animalcare business. This performance primarily  reflects the impact of lower gross margins,  investments to support future growth and the  disposal of Nutriscience which Ecuphar sold in  October 2016. Including non-underlying items,  the Group’s profit before tax decreased to £0.5m  (2016: £5.1m). The Group generated £2.6m  (2016: £9.3m) net cash from operations which  included a cash outflow from non-underlying  items totalling £3.8m.  Further details on business performance  can be found in the CEO Review and CFO  Review respectively. Board Following the acquisition, the executive Directors  comprised Chris Cardon, who took on the role of  Chief Executive Officer for the enlarged group,  supported by Iain Menneer as Chief Operating  Officer and Walter Beyers as Chief Financial  Officer. In September 2017 Chris Brewster, who  at the time of the acquisition stood down as a  Board Director but remained within the business,  was reappointed to the Board as Chief Financial  Officer, replacing Walter Beyers who resigned   to pursue other interests. More recently Iain  Menneer stood down as Chief Operating Officer.  I would like to take the OUR GROUP AT A GLANCE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Animalcare Group plc Annual Report 2017 www.animalcaregroup.co.uk Stock Code: ANCR 13 STRATEGIC REPORT  OUR PERFORMANCE 26011   18/05/2018   Proof 4 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW Following the acquisition this segment now includes the products  that were previously categorised as Licensed Veterinary Medicines,  Animal Welfare and Companion Animal Identification. Based on the statutory results for the year ended 31 st  December  2017, sales in this division (net of intercompany sales) increased by  28.4% to £59.7m (2016: £46.5m), which now accounts for 71.4%  of total revenues. The £13.2m year-on-year increase is attributable  to an additional £7.6m of sales derived from acquisition growth,  with the balance generated through organic growth within the  Ecuphar business. Organic growth was driven by a number of factors including a  very strong performance from sales into the Production Animals  market, as well as strong growth from Companion Animals.  In the division our top 20 pharmaceutical products, which account  for 51% of this division’s total sales, grew by 15.1% in 2017.  Looking at our direct sales markets, Orozyme, the first product  of the Company that was developed, continues to hold a strong  position in the Oro-dental area. Direct sales for this product grew  by 11% and we expect to see further growth in this area through  the launch of new innovative products in 2018.  Leisguard, our treatment against leishmaniosis in dogs, showed  strong sales across our Mediterranean footprint and we expect to  see future growth for this product in 2018 in Scandinavia. Prazitel  and Caniquantel, which both play an important role in the area of  anti-parasitic treatment, also grew well in 2017. We were pleased with the performance across our export  network. Our key core export markets of France, the Nordics and  UK and Ireland showed significant growth and we expect to benefit  from ongoing direct sales in the UK now following the acquisition.  During the period we signed new distribution agreements to cover  New Zealand and Taiwan and both regions granted regulatory  approval
