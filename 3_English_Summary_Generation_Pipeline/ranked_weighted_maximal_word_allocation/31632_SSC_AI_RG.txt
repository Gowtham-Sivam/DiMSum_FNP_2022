The renowned  and enduring appeal of London’ s West End to a global audience  of visitors and businesses brings a resilience to its economy not  seen elsewhere in the UK and in very few cities across the world. Underpinned by an estimated 200 million annual visits to the  West End, our business focusses on the 1.1 million sq. ft. of restaurant,  leisure and retail space that we own in high profile, popular locations.  With our forensic knowledge of the West End, we curate  distinctive, interesting and lively destinations which attract  Londoners, a large and important local working population,  domestic visitors, and international tourists in numbers  unmatched by any city destination in the western world.  Continuing value creation and  income growth Our portfolio, now valued 1  at £3.64 billion, continues to deliver  rental and capital growth, but with relatively low capital  expenditure.  We have continued our long record of crystallising locations. 7 STRATEGIC REPORT  OVERVIEW  Shaftesbury Annual Report 2017 Chief  Executive’s  Statement   It is pleasing to report another year of good progress and strong results,  against a backdrop of economic uncertainty.       Growing earnings Continued demand for space in our popular and busy  locations, together with our proven management strategy,  has resulted in an increase in net property income of 5.0%  to £88.3 million. We are now reaping the benefits of the  important refinancing initiatives we completed in October last  year , which significantly reduced our finance costs. T ogether ,  these factors have contributed to an increase in EPRA  earnings 1  of £6.2 million to £45.2 million, which equates to  an increase in EPRA earnings per share1 of 15.7%.  Uplift in NAV Our exceptional portfolio has delivered underlying capital  value growth of 7.0% over the year, adding 83 pence (9.3%)  to EPRA net asset value per share 1 . The increase in value  reflects the combined impact of growing current income  and the prospect of sustained future income growth,  particularly in locations which are expected to benefit from  Crossrail-related footfall in the coming years. Limited  opportunities to buy the type of buildings we own, and  continuing strong investor demand, have led to a reduction  in investment yields in the West End market, particularly in  the second half of the year. This valuation uplift has been offset partly by the cost of  terminating our remaining legacy interest rate swaps, which  amounted to 20 pence per share. At 30 September 2017,  EPRA NAV per share 1  stood at £9.52, an increase of 64  pence, or 7.2%.   1 Alternative performance measures (APMs).
