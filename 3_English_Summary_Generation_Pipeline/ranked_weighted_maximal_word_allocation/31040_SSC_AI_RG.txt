Polypipe supplied a complete  prefabricated solution using Polystorm  geocellular tanks, together with pipework,  manholes and catchpits all manufactured  off-site. The final design saw the installation  of two Polystorm geocellular tanks at a depth  of 3.2 metres, under two resident owned car  parks on the Linnet Rise site, providing 366m 3   and 479m 3  of storage respectively. The solution  was retrofitted to the existing area with  minimal disruption to local residents to provide  long-lasting flood protection. This retrofitted   flood alleviation   scheme was designed  and prepared off-site   to minimise disruption  for this busy   residential area MARKET LEADERSHIP BESPOKE PRODUCT SOLUTIONS 02 STRATEGIC REPORT POLYPIPE AT A GLANCE 04 CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 06 POLYPIPE’S VALUE-CREATION MODEL 07 POLYPIPE’S MARKETPLACE 08 POLYPIPE’S BUSINESS MODEL 10 STRATEGY 12 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS 14 OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY 15 OUR SUSTAINABLE JOURNEY IN ACTION 18 CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S REVIEW 22 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REPORT 26 PRINCIPAL RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES 30 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT 35 CASE STUDY Project Linnet Rise Flood Alleviation Scheme,  Kidderminster Client NMCNomenca; Severn Trent Water Application Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) Car park in use after project completion 03 RESIDENTIAL SYSTEMS Areas of application  { Above-ground drainage  { Storm water drainage  { Below-ground drainage systems  { Sewer drain  { Water supply  { Plumbing and heating supply  { Underfloor heating systems  { Mechanical Ventilation with   Heat Recovery  { Positive Input Ventilation  { Indoor air quality solutions  { Smart controls  { Merchandised, pre-packaged components Areas of application  { Above-ground drainage  { Surface water drainage  { Storm water drainage  { Land drainage and irrigation  { Sewer drain  { Ducting and conduit  { Pressure systems  { Air Handling Units  { Ventilation solutions with heat recovery  { Indoor air quality solutions  { Smart controls integrated with Building  Management Systems  { Green infrastructure REVENUE 22 Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 Polypipe Group plc 22 In June 2017, a trade embargo was  introduced between Qatar and many of  the Gulf states following ongoing political  disagreements. With approximately  60% of our pipeline projects emanating  from Qatar, and the more general  project financing issues in the wider  Gulf in the first half of the year, the  decision was taken to temporarily cease  manufacturing in our Dubai facility, and  a non-underlying charge of £0.9m was  recorded in our interim results covering  redundancy costs and stock provisions.  During the second half of the year there  has been no change to the situation  between Qatar and the other Gulf states;  the trade embargo remains in force, and  general project financing still appears  to be slow as the region adjusts to a  lower oil price. While the Middle East still  represents a significant opportunity for  the Group, we have decided to pursue an  alternative manufacturing strategy in the  region through use of sub-contractors  and to close permanently our Dubai  manufacturing facility. All equipment will  be relocated back to our Horncastle plant  where Polystorm is manufactured for the  UK market, enabling us to remove the  need for more expensive sub-contract  manufacturing in the UK. A further non- underlying charge of £3.1m has been  recorded covering machinery relocation  costs, further redundancy, onerous lease  costs and asset impairments, leaving the  total non-underlying charge for the year  at £4.0m, of which £1.7m is non-cash.  As well as expanding capacity where  necessary, we continue to invest in both  new product technology and automation  in our businesses. Our new £2.2m  multi-layer extrusion lines in our main  Doncaster plant became operational in  the early part of 2017 which has allowed  us to significantly increase the amount of  recycled material used in manufacturing  our drainage and latterly our soil and  waste pipes. Towards the end of the  year, our new £5.0m large diameter  continuous corrugator came into  operation at our Horncastle plant. This  increases our capacity to manufacture  750mm and 900mm drainage pipes  and allows the Group to make further  inroads in this area of the market. These  new pipes, as well as much of our  existing civils drainage pipe offer, are  manufactured from recycled milk bottles  and other polyethylene consumer liquid  bottles using our wash plant recycling  facility at Horncastle. We consume  approximately 44,000 tonnes of recycled  material representing one-third of the  overall material requirement across the  Group, and both of these projects further  enhance our already strong sustainability  and recycling credentials, something that  is important to Polypipe, our customers  and our wider stakeholders. As well as new product technology,  there has been further investment  in automation in the year to expand  capacity, but also to test out new  automation
