It took us two months longer  than I had hoped, but we hit this target  in February 2018. This is perhaps our  most significant achievement to date  and positions Nostra Terra for exciting  growth ahead, as we seek to introduce  larger assets to the Company with  much more potential upside.  Revenues for the year were £1,128,000  an increase of 300% from 2016. Loss for  the year was £1,044,000. In April 2017  the Company raised £500,000 through  an equity placing at 2 pence per share.  Included in this were 1 for 1 warrants,  exercisable within 12 months at 3 pence  per share. Nearly all of the warrants  were exercised by April 2018, raising an  additional £738,000 for the Company. Moving forward we will certainly  seek to build on this success, through  further drilling across our existing  portfolio of assets. However, now that  we are in a much more secure position  financially, with a stronger balance  sheet, we can also afford to explore  a more ambitious acquisition plan.  If successful this change in approach  could significantly increase Nostra Terra’s  growth trajectory. My vision has always been to build  a much larger company, built on solid  fundamentals. The first phase of this  plan is now complete and I am excited  about the next phase ahead.  United States Pine Mills, Texas Having secured our initial stake (80%  working interest) in the Pine Mills oil  field in late 2016, our operations team  made an immediate impact. By the turn  of the year we were able to report two  consecutive months of profitable oil  production at Pine Mills and have  sustained that record every month  since. Furthermore, Pine Mills has  provided us with such stable and  consistent excess cash flow that it  has become the cornerstone of our  turnaround strategy. This very much confirms our  original basis for acquiring Pine Mills  and the subsequent strategic efforts  we expended in the first half of 2017 to  secure 100% of the asset. Subsequently,  we were able to include all revenues  generated at Pine Mills in 2017 in our  reported figures.  Due to the stable production at  Pine Mills and the performance of our  operational team, in September 2017  we secured a hedging facility with BP  Energy Company. This was a significant  achievement for a company of Nostra  Terra’s size and marked a turning  point for the Company. To secure the hedging facility we  underwent a vigorous due diligence  process. We were able to demonstrate  an established track record of consistent  production and the viability of our  long-term model consolidating efforts  made in the first half of 2017. Permian Basin, Texas Having secured the hedging facility,  we were confident we would be able  to obtain a new Senior Lending Facility.  Initial discussions with a number of  banks went well and this gave us  confidence to press ahead with the  third acquisition in the Permian Basin,  where we would drill the Twin Well.  This acquisition, in late October 2017,  marked another step change in  our delivery. Prior to the acquisition, the  neighbouring operator inadvertently  drilled a well into the lease, which  produced 350 barrels of oil in less  than three days. Because of this  error the neighbouring operator  had to plug and abandon its well  and was required to provide us  with the well data. It has since produced at a strong  rate above 50bopd. From permitting  to getting paid took less than  four months. We now have approximately 22 drill  ready locations across our existing  Permian Basin assets. Assuming  we are able to continue growing  production here, it is clear there is  potential to increase significantly  underlying value.  We retain interest and receive  revenues from additional assets  located in Oklahoma, Colorado and  Wyoming. These are not substantial  and are considered non-core assets. Egypt While we’ve made positive inroads in  the country with the Government and  local contact, unfortunately we have  not been able to find a solution to the  legacy issues with the Concession’s  operator, North Petroleum (“North”),  and the case has now been referred  to international arbitration.  We have been proactive in  suggesting solutions to the issues  raised, and sought positive resolutions.  Nevertheless, Nostra Terra will now  defend its position rigorously. Senior Lending Facility At the beginning of 2017 we  secured a new $5 million Senior Lending  Facility. The initial borrowing base was  $1.2 million at a 4.75% interest rate.  The facility will be reviewed at least  twice
