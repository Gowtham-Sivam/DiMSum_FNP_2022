INVESTMENT OUTPERFORMANCE  IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT  WE DO We aim to deliver value for money to  our clients through active fund  management that delivers long‑term  investment outperformance, after all fees.  Investment outperformance helps us to  grow our assets under management  (AUM), by ensuring we keep existing  clients and attract new ones.

OUR PEOPLE AND CULTURE  ARE KEY We believe that talented individuals who  are free to pursue their own investment  styles can make the most difference for  clients. With no ‘house view’ to constrain  them, our fund managers actively seek  the best investment opportunities through  fundamental analysis, with a focus on  good stewardship. Our fund CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION 5 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Jupiter Fund Management plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW A STRONG YEAR 2017 was a good year for Jupiter  across all our activities: three-year  investment performance, net inflows  and delivery on a number of strategic  projects. This was delivered within a  supportive market environment. The key measure of our investment  performance is the percentage of mutual  fund AUM with above‑ median performance,  after all fees, over three years. This  increased from 75% in 2016 to 81% in 2017,  as our clients continued to benefit from our  culture of high performance, independent  thinking and accountability.  I was very pleased with the net inflows  of £5.5bn (2016: £1.0bn), which help to  show the success of our diversification  strategy, with positive inflows across  each quarter. These inflows, coupled  with our investment outperformance  and market movements, resulted in a  24% increase in our AUM. This, in turn,  underpinned our financial performance. Net revenues totalled £409.5m, up 17%  (2016: £351.4m), including a 19% increase  in net management fees to £392.4m  (2016: £330.2m). The adjusted cost  income ratio was steady at 55%, which  meant that the revenue growth funded  continued investment in our business and  platform as well as increased profitability.  Statutory profit before tax rose by 13%  to £192.9m; underlying profit before tax  increased from £168.4m in 2016 to  £193.8m in 2017, representing growth of  15%. Underlying earnings per share were  16% higher at 34.2p (2016: 29.4p). The  Group converts a high proportion of  earnings into cash, generating operating  cash flows after tax of £194.6m in 2017  (2016: £147.3m). This supports our ability  to maintain a strong balance sheet  position while paying significant  dividends to shareholders. Our strategic progress was recognised  in 2017 when Investment Week named  Jupiter ‘Global Group of the Year’, based  on our ‘strong investment performance  across the board and a developing pool  of rising talent, combined with a  willingness to tackle industry issues  ahead of others’. This award reflects our  transformation over the past five years  and our adaptability in changing  regulatory environments. A successful diversification strategy All regions contributed to our net  inflows in 2017, with the offices in Italy  and Spain exceeding our expectations  for the year. In total, the international  distribution platform we have built  provided 75% of our net inflows in 2017,  without requiring significant additional  resources in country to deliver that  growth. The UK also grew in 2017, as  inflows to investment strategies launched  in recent years more than offset outflows  from our longstanding fund of funds  strategy. Fixed income has been a major  contributor to our AUM
