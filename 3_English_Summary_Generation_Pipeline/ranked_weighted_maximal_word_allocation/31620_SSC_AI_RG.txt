Financial results The Group’s trading results for the year  ended 30 September 2017 show revenue  of £21.56 million (2016: £21.32 million)  and operating profit of £3.90 million  (2016: £3.69 million) after adjusting for  the amortisation of acquisition-related  intangibles, ‘one-off’ non-recurring items and  share-based payment charges. The ‘one-off’  non-recurring items, totalling £0.49 million,  include costs relating to potential acquisitions  during the year, the consolidation of office  premises with internal reorganisation, as  well as the costs incurred in changing the  Group Finance Director. Mitigating and  offsetting these costs, was the receipt in full,  of a licence fee from a former customer who  had been disputing payment relating to their  access of the Group’s software. Overall, gross margin remains high at 82%  (2016: 84%) and though slightly lower than  the prior year, the continuing high gross  margin reflects the continued emphasis  and focus upon the supply of Sanderson  proprietary software and services. Recurring  revenue, which is revenue derived from pre- contracted software licence fees and ongoing  support services, increased to £11.18 million  (2016: £10.75 million) representing 52%  of total revenue in the period (2016:  50%). Sales order intake grew by 12% to Group Chief Executive’s business review More rapid growth  available via Digital  Retail and renewed  impetus for growth from  the Enterprise business  is expected to enable  the Group to meet its  strategic targets. Ian Newcombe Group Chief Executive The target market for Sanderson products  and services primarily comprises of ‘SMEs’  (‘small and medium-sized enterprises’). The  Group’s well-developed business model is  to foster long-term customer relationships  which result in a high proportion of sales  arising from pre-contracted recurring  revenue, complemented by incremental  sales to its strong, well-established and  growing customer base. This robust business  stream usually accounts for around 50%  of Group revenues. Sanderson proprietary  software is developed in anticipation of  technological developments and often in  conjunction, collaboration and partnership  with its large customer base. Sanderson  proprietary software is marketed and sold  under a ‘right to use’ licence with all sales,  marketing, delivery, support and services  being carried out by the Group’s own   expert staff. Group business solutions are developed  and marketed in order to provide customers  with ‘value for money’ IT systems, designed  to offer cost effective, timely and tangible  business benefits. These solutions  typically enable customers to increase  revenue whilst also achieving additional  efficiencies by making and maintaining cost  savings, both often within twelve months  of implementation.
