JM Barry Gibson Chairman  23 May 2017 Chairman’s statement I am delighted that the Group had  another very good year delivering  customer and profit growth, with  continued investment to deliver our  strategy.

Affinity partner  households increased by 10m to  102m, with a significant increase in  North America. This is in addition  to 11% Group customer growth,  with customer numbers now at  7.8m. Statutory operating profit was  up 20% to £104.7m, and adjusted  operating profit increased 22% to  £118.8m, both included a £10.3m  foreign exchange benefit.   A solid performance in the UK delivered  over half of the Group’s operating profit,  while we also continued to invest in new  partnerships, network capability, LeakBot  and heating services.  The business in North America had  a transformational year, completing  the acquisition and integration of  Utility Service Partners Inc. (USP)  while continuing to sign new partners  organically. As a result, we made rapid  progress towards the targeted 80m  affinity partner households, where 18m  households were added during FY17,  taking total access to 50m households.  Organic customer growth was 10% and,  together with USP, customer numbers  increased to 3.0m, up 28% on the prior  year.  We have seen good customer growth  and profit progression in our established  businesses in France and Spain with  customer numbers increasing 4% to   1.0m and 7% to 1.3m respectively. The  Group retention rate was strong at 82%  (FY16: 83%). We invested £6.0m in the New Markets  segment, as planned (FY16: £5.9m).
