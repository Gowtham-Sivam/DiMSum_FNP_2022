I am pleased to report another strong year of trading  for Sirius in what is my first Annual Report as Chairman  of the Company. Sirius has continued to grow organically  through its capex investment programme and its asset  management techniques as well as acquisitively using  the proceeds of two successful capital raisings in the  period. This has significantly increased the profitability  and value of the Company and culminated with the move  of its shares to the main markets of both the London  and Johannesburg stock exchanges on 6 March 2017.  We indicated last year that asset recycling was going  to be a major element of our continued growth going  forward and I am pleased to say that we successfully  agreed the sale of two major core assets at well above  book value and completed the disposal of a non-core  asset in the period. An additional mature asset,  located in Kiel, was notarised for sale at €7.0 million  after the period end. This, along with the proceeds  of a €15.0 million private placing which completed at  the end of the period, will provide the Company with  substantial capital to reinvest into new assets in the  next financial year. This continued growth is reflected in all of the  key metrics upon which the Company is measured.  Adjusted profit before tax* was up by 54% to  €35.3 million (2016: €22.9 million), basic European  Public Real Estate Association (“EPRA”) EPS increased  by 69.1% to 3.18c (2016: 1.88c). This has fed through  to the Group’s valuations, which saw a like-for-like  increase of 8.5% in the year contributing to an  increase in EPRA NAV per share of 9.7% to 57.84c  (2016: 52.72c), whilst adjusted NAV per share**  increased by 10.3% to 58.82c (2016: 53.35c).  The disciplined manner in which the Company has  executed its strategy of providing conventional and  flexible workspace whilst developing its sub-optimal  vacant space into both conventional space and the  Group’s range of flexible Smartspace products has  also increased the quality of its portfolio and the  sustainability
