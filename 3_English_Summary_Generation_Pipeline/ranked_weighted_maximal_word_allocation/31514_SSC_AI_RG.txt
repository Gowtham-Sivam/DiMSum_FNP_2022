Led by a strong performance of the i newspaper, adjusted EBITDA   is in line with expectations.  Trading In 2017, we worked hard to combat the  continued downward pressure on print  publishing revenue, both in advertising and  circulation. A key component of our plan  saw a wholesale modernisation in   the organisation and operation of our sales  teams for local markets, as we seek to build  a class-leading centralised tele-sales  operation with deep local market  knowledge. After an initial bedding in  period, these changes are starting to  show results. Statutory revenue reduced from   £222.7 million in 2016 to £201.6 million in  2017, of which £9.9 million of the reduction  related to the sale of 13 titles in the East  Midlands. The Group reported a loss   of £78.6 million in 2017, compared to  £247.3 million in 2016. The loss resulted  from non-cash asset impairment charges  of £64.4 million, mark-to-market on the  bond, as a result of increases in value, and  exceptional costs. Adjusted operating profit  was £33.1 million, down from £36.9 million  in 2016, reflecting the challenging trading  environment in which the Group operates. Strategy As I reported last year, 2017 started with the  sale of 13 titles in the East Midlands and  East Anglia to Iliffe Media Limited in  January 2017. This helped to strengthen   our balance sheet, reducing net debt   and increasing liquidity and enabled the  Group to cancel its revolving credit facility. We have progressed our Strategic Review  of our financing options in relation to the  £220 million 8.625% senior secured notes  (the ‘Bonds’) which become due on 1 June
