In addition, we have launched two successful independent secondary funds, JLIF and JLEN, which are the purchasers of a number of our investments once the underlying projects reach the operational stage. As well as announcing our results, we are today launching a 1 for 3 rights issue to raise £210 million, net of costs. The rights issue will enable the Group to take advantage of a higher proportion of the attractive opportunities currently available to it and is consistent with the Board’s intention to increase the scale of the business over the medium term. We plan to use the proceeds to invest in public private partnership (PPP) projects, renewable energy assets, and in other appropriate greenfield infrastructure assets which fit our business model and meet our investment criteria. The Board considers the rights issue to be in the best interests of John Laing and its shareholders as a whole. During 2017, as in earlier years, we kept our strategy focused but also flexible. Our business model has stood the test of time and allows the management team to concentrate on the core tasks of origination of greenfield projects; active management of construction and operational risk; and timely realisations in order to monetise investments. We committed capital to each of our three core regions – Asia Pacific, Europe and North America – in the year. The US market in particular is now showing the potential we have been anticipating for Company’s AGM which will be held on 10 May 2018. At the Company’s last AGM on 11 May 2017, all resolutions were approved by shareholders. Our business is in good shape and, based on our investment pipeline, we anticipate a strong level of deal flow over the coming years in each of our core markets.

In the case of urbanisation, some commentators forecast that within 20 years, two out of every three people will live in a city. Other factors which influence infrastructure spending include governmental policy towards regulation and investment, the demand for energy and the availability of capital, both private and public sector. Most of these factors apply to each of the sectors in which we operate: transport and transport-related infrastructure, such as roads, tunnels, bridges and rail assets; environmental infrastructure, such as renewable energy, water treatment and waste management; and social infrastructure, such as schools and hospitals. We are proud of the fact that many of the assets we invest in provide a public benefit. We operate in a wider infrastructure market in which there has been historical under-investment. This provides a strong incentive for governments to use public private partnerships (PPPs) to procure greenfield infrastructure. As well as access to private capital, PPP arrangements enable governmental and other public sector bodies to benefit from fixed price arrangements which transfer very significant risks to the private sector, especially design, construction and operational delivery risks. The growing international adoption of PPPs as a procurement model for infrastructure is acknowledged by the World Bank which publishes a PPP Reference Guide.
