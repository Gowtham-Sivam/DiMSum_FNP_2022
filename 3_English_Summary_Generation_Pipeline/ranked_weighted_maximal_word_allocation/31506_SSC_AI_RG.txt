We are confident in our ability to continue to increase both our capabilities and shareholder value moving forward ” I am pleased to report to shareholders in respect of the year ended 31 December 2017. The year under review saw the Company make encouraging progress to its longer-term objective of being a leading international provider of regulatory compliance software and professional services. Our current focus is on the corporation tax software and services market in the UK and Ireland. In this business we met all internal and external targets including increasing our revenue, contracted annuity base and number of new customers. Of particular note has been the level of cash generated from the business, which has allowed us the reduce debt levels faster than initially planned. Further details of our progress in 2017 is set out in the following CEO and CFO reports. We made significant investments during 2017 to maintain, update and de-risk our solutions and services in light of the increasing regulatory landscape. Over time we expect more demand for automation and process control which is where we want to provide enhanced functionality and value. We look forward to extending our technology offering by way of continued product development and targeted acquisitions. In particular, in the shorter term, to broaden the range of taxes covered. The integration of OSMO, acquired in April 2017, was largely completed and considered a successful transition. OSMO’s leading edge technology is now embedded as part of our core value proposition and helps organisations automate the collection of data from large accounting / ERP systems.  We firmly believe we are well placed to exploit the opportunities that will arise from the ever-greater digitalisation of tax compliance and in compliance more generally. We look forward to the future with confidence.

Using OSMO’s technology, finance and tax teams can significantly decrease the manual workload associated with data collection, reduce errors and risk from re-keying data and increase the speed and accuracy of data production. OSMO’s solution is an ideal add-on to the existing software and services that Tax Systems already provides.  I am pleased with OSMO’s progress to date; the team delivered against its 2017 performance expectations and have fitted in well both technically and culturally. We have one final stage of the integration left which is moving OSMO’s core IT systems and processes onto our standard operating platform within shared services. This activity has begun and is expected to be finished by the end of H1 2018. At that point we can consider the business fully integrated.  In addition, further acquisition targets were identified and considered during the year. Disappointingly we declined to proceed with two potential targets after finalising the due diligence process but in both cases it was the right decision for the business.  We continue to actively evaluate other acquisition opportunities but will only proceed where we believe a business is the right strategic fit and will enhance both the Company’s offering and shareholder value.  Debt reduction:  During 2017, we reduced our net debt by 16% to £20.5m as a result of our revenue growth, customer retention rate and excellent cash conversion. In addition, we were also successful in recovering £0.6m of VAT relating to the fees payable on the acquisition of T ax Computer Systems Limited (“TCSL”) in July 2016.  Net debt at the end of the year represented less than 3x Adjusted EBITDA. By continuing to focus on sustainable growth and
