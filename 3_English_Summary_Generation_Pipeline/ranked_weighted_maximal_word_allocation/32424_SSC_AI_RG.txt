Chairman’s Statement Overview of 2016/17  The financial year ended 31 March 2017 can be  split into two halves. In the first six months of  the financial year, the uncertainty surrounding  the run-up to the Brexit referendum and the  subsequent challenging markets slowed  revenue growth. This, coupled with a  combination of non-recurring employment  costs and growth-related development costs,  saw our profitability fall well below our  expectation. We saw a stronger performance,   in the last six months, when improved market  conditions, favourably impacted by the result of  the US presidential elections, helped increase  both revenues and profit.  Importantly, our Assets Under Management  and Administration, a key metric of  performance, continue to grow. Whilst we have  recently experienced the benefits of more  upbeat market conditions, the full ramifications  of the negotiations on Brexit, together with the  uncertainty arising from the outcome of the UK  general election, have yet to emerge. Therefore,  we will be monitoring developments closely in  the interests of both shareholders and clients.  Dividend  In recognition of this year’s progress, and  notwithstanding the need to continue  monitoring an increasing cost base, the Board   is recommending a 1.6% increase in the final  dividend to 1.29 pence per share (2016: 1.27  pence per share). This increase in the dividend  reflects the Board’s confidence in the Group’s  long-term prospects and prudent use of  available reserves.  Combined with the interim dividend of  0.58 pence per share (2016: 0.58 pence  per share), the total dividend for the year  is 1.87 pence per share (2016: 1.85 pence  per share), a 1.1 % increase. The final  dividend will be paid on 15 September  2017 to shareholders on the register at the  close
