 16    Chairman’s Statement  A DEMANDING YEAR “The second half provides  the platform for growth”     A mixed performance against challenging market  conditions    “The Group had a mixed trading year based on a weak first half being offset by a  strong second half performance and record order book entering the new financial  year”    The Board  Key areas of focus for the Board in FY2018  These areas include inter alia:   Evolution of our marketing and sales strategy;    Further development of our people;   Utilising the Centre of Excellence to its full potential;   Enhancing the position of Peter Brotherhood in its end markets; and   Completion of the announced transaction with Avingtrans plc.    Dear Shareholder  I am sorry to report on a mixed trading year albeit mitigated by a record order book as  we move into the new financial year FY2018.  Acknowledging the demanding trading  period I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Executive Directors and all the  team, on your behalf, for their contribution in a very challenging market and their  tireless devotion in ensuring the long-term security of both Hayward Tyler and Peter  Brotherhood.    Results Overview  The results for the year reflect a steady performance from the Hayward Tyler and Peter  Brotherhood businesses at the gross contribution level but a lack of revenue particularly in the  first half of FY2017 ultimately meant that we only achieved breakeven at the trading 1  EBITDA  level for the full year, which generated a reported loss for the year of £3.9 million (FY2016:  profit of £2.4 million).    Against a backdrop of challenging end markets and continuing uncertain economic times,  Hayward Tyler’s performance was dampened in 1H2017 before recovering strongly in  2H2017 and we expect it to strengthen in FY2018. This strengthening will come from amongst  other things; the improving prospects for Peter Brotherhood and the beneficial impact of the  Centre of Excellence, which when utilised more fully will drive greater profitability. The major  focus for HTG looking forward continues to be the development of the order pipeline and  order book to create a significantly higher revenue business.       Further details of the trading performance are set out in the Chief Executive’s Business  Review and the Financial Review.    Dividend  Given the announced proposed acquisition of the Company by Avingtrans plc we do not  intend to recommend the payment of a final dividend for FY2017.  We understand that  Avingtrans plc has a progressive dividend policy.

Achievements   Ended the year with a record order book and a clear strategy of how to drive  further growth in order intake going into the new fiscal year;    Continued to rebuild accreditations and customer relationships at Peter  Brotherhood with our first major order won and first significant order  shipped;   Created a new Group Commercial role, recruited a new person to the role  and put in place a new structure to support the ‘win-order’ process;   Completed the major investment in our world-class Centre of Excellence for  specialist motor manufacture; and   Welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to open our new facility and  present us with the Queen’s Award for Export (International Trade).  Priorities for FY2018   Secure a suitable funding structure to support the long-term future of the Group to  take advantage of the opportunities for both Peter Brotherhood and Hayward Tyler;   Drive further growth in order intake reflecting the improving market conditions and  the Group’s competitiveness;   Cut the Group’s cost base to support a more flexible and profitable business; and   Continue to deliver the operational improvements supported by the increased order  book.     Introduction  When I wrote in last year’s review that “provided recent economic and political uncertainty  does not affect general industrial activity, the outlook for HTG is positive” I perhaps did not  appreciate how prescient that comment might be.       From a financial perspective the year can be characterised using the sporting analogy, “a  game of two halves”. The first half was disappointing but our second half was much more in  Hayward Tyler Group PLC  Financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017       19    line with previous periods and more representative of the underlying Group and its future  prospects.
