The increase in  AUM was due entirely to market and currency movement as it was another year of net outflows  from our funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however markedly lower than last year  and over the second half of the year we returned to net inflows.

The  increase in AUM was due entirely to market and currency  movement as it was another year of net outflows from our  funds. The level of net outflows of £230m was however  markedly lower than last year and over the second half of  the year we returned to net inflows. Stock markets around the world were surprisingly buoyant  over the period although this was not reflected in flows  into active equity funds as it was another challenging year  for the industry with passive products continuing to take  market share. Across Europe active equity funds suffered  net outflows of €60bn and in the UK it was the worst year  for retail fund flows for over 20 years! In this context our reducing levels of net outflows provide  grounds for encouragement. Funds and Performance Despite the very challenging industry conditions eight  of our twelve strategies recorded positive net inflows  over the financial year. The four strategies that suffered  outflows were Japan, GEMS and North America on the  long-only side and European Long/Short on the absolute  return side. Although the main Japan UCITS fund experienced  further substantial outflows, it is pleasing to see a sharp  improvement in Chief Executive’s Report For the year ended 31 March 2017 Tim Woolley Chief Executive Officer and Founder Our Chairman referred in his Statement to the fact that last year was a disappointing year for active managers and that  indeed many of our funds failed to beat their benchmarks. Whilst disappointing one should never read too much into a  single year – our history has shown that backing a good active manager over the long-term delivers better returns net   of all costs than betting on a passive benchmark product. Many clients would agree that the US market is regarded as the most efficient and most difficult in which to beat  the benchmark, yet if you had invested $10,000 in our North America UCITS fund over 1, 3, 5 years or since launch,  your returns would be comfortably ahead of the benchmark return net of all costs in every one of those periods, as  indicated below.
