DEAR SHAREHOLDER, FY17 has been both a challenging and  rewarding year. We made our largest  acquisition ever in the US and have step- changed our UK business through organic  growth. There were some challenges in  delivering a programme of such complexity,  with an impact on operating leverage in the  period and with considerable investment   and restructuring charges incurred. However,  as a result of the significant activity delivered  in the year, we are now well positioned to  secure profitable growth and returns in the  coming years.  STRATEGIC DEVELOPMENT In FY17 we made further progress in   achieving our vision to become a fast-growing,  international convenience food leader. This  vision and our strategy shape the direction   of the Group. A complete outline of our  strategic framework is provided on pages   13 to 17, with examples of how this was  implemented in FY17 and the priorities in  place for FY18. The key highlight of the year was the  completion of the acquisition of Peacock  Foods on 30 December 2016. The acquisition  transforms our market and channel position   in the US and has given us a growth platform  of real scale. The enlarged US business has a  well invested network, serving a diversified  customer base across multiple channels.  Integration is on track and the focus is on  exploiting the potential of the commercial  pipeline of outsourcing and innovation-led  opportunities.  *    The Group uses Alternative Performance Measures  GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 10 Chief Executive’s Review Patrick Coveney Securing profitable  growth and returns This year has been about   setting the Group up for   profitable growth and returns   in a dynamic marketplace. 11 GREENCORE GROUP PLC | ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2017 Q:  IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR,   YOU ANNOUNCED THE BOARD’S  INTENTION TO ACQUIRE PEACOCK  FOODS. YOU ARE NEARLY A YEAR INTO  YOUR OWNERSHIP – HOW HAS PEACOCK  FOODS INTEGRATED INTO THE GROUP? Our acquisition of Peacock Foods in December  2016 was both the largest transaction and   the most transformational portfolio and  organisational change in Greencore’s history.  Our US business has now increased to more  than four times its original size and we are,  more than ever, an international convenience  food leader. Of course, with the acquisition,   we have also welcomed 3,000 new colleagues  into our Group.  The onboarding, integration, and development  of Peacock Foods is going well. There is ‘much  to do’ but we are excited by what the new  business brings in every respect. We are  learning a lot too. Having visited our new sites,  met with many new colleagues, and engaged  extensively with the Peacock Foods’ original  customers, I am struck by how aligned we are  culturally – a strong theme which has been  evident since our first interactions with the  Peacock Foods leadership team. In terms of  culture, people, commercial relationships,  strategy and momentum we have a platform  now to deliver our US strategy and Group vision.  Q:  YOU RECENTLY ANNOUNCED A SET  OF ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES   IN THE UK? WHAT IS THE REASONING  BEHIND THEM AND WHAT BENEFITS WILL  THE NEW APPROACH BRING?
