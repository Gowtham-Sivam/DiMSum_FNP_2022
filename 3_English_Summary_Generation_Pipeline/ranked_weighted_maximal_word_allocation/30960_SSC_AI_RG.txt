The Group has made  good progress in securing new  contracts despite the protracted  market recovery. The Group has delivered an adjusted EBITDA  for 2017 of US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$  106.8 million) in what was a challenging year  for the oil and gas industry. Our continued  focus on cost management has enabled   us to achieve an adjusted EBITDA margin   of 52% (2016: 60%). A loss for the year of  US$ 18.2 million (2016: net profit of US$ 29.4  million) has been reported, although the  underlying performance after adjusting for  certain items, was a net profit of US$ 4.8  million (2016: US$ 50.7 million).  No dividend will be paid for 2017. The Board  believes the cash generated by the business  is better utilised for the reduction of bank  debt at this time. Shareholder priorities  continue to be recognised and dividend  payments will be resumed as soon as  reasonable financial prudence allows. During the year we agreed certain amendments  to our bank facilities, which has increased our  liquidity and financial flexibility and this will allow  us to benefit from improving market conditions.  We have been encouraged by the increasing  levels of enquiries and tender activity in the  Middle East and Europe. During 2017, the  Group secured five new contracts with a  total charter period of just under eight years.  Our backlog stands at US$ 160.6 million   as at 1 March 2018 (all contracts include  option periods).  Vessel age has become increasingly   relevant, with our clients currently able   to demonstrate a preference for modern  tonnage. Our investment in our new build  programme has ensured GMS is well-placed  to address this in tenders, with our fleet CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW We were pleased to secure three  long-term contracts and two short- term contracts in 2017 in what  continued to be a challenging  market for our industry.  The prolonged downturn affected both our  vessel utilisation and charter rates (through  deferral of contract awards, discussed  further below, and suppressed demand)   and is reflected in significantly reduced  profitability reported by GMS for 2017.   A more stable oil price environment is  welcomed and it is encouraging to see  increasing levels of enquiries and tender  activity for our services in the Middle East  and Europe. Group financial performance Revenue for the year was US$ 112.9 million  (2016: US$ 179.4 million) and adjusted  EBITDA was US$ 58.5 million (2016: US$  106.8 million). The Group’s continued focus  on cost management helped to deliver an  adjusted EBITDA margin of 52% (2016: 60%).  Although the Company is reporting a statutory  loss for the year of US$ 18.2 million (2016:  net profit of US$ 29.4 million), the underlying  performance after adjusting items, was   a net profit for the year of US$ 4.8 million  (2016: US$ 50.7 million).  During the year we made certain amendments  to our bank facility agreement that have  provided the Group with increased liquidity  and financial flexibility (further details can   be found in the Financial Review). We were  pleased to have the full support of our  banking partners through this process and  appreciate their confidence in our business. Fleet utilisation and order book Utilisation of our core fleet of 13 SESVs was  61% in the year (2016: 70%), delivering an  improvement of 13 percentage points on Q4  2016. Demand has been relatively good for  the Large Class and Mid-Size Class vessels  in the current market, with both classes  achieving utilisation above 70% for 2017  (Small Class vessel utilisation was 53%).   This has been a validation of the investment
