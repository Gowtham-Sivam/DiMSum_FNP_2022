We design, manufacture and  distribute high quality, high  performance, premium branded  products and solutions that  enable end users to capture and  share exceptional images. Our  products typically attach to, or  support, a camera – primarily for  broadcast, cinematic, pro-video  and photographic applications.   The Vitec Group is organised in  three Divisions and has strong  market positions in each. Vitec’s Imaging Solutions Division designs, manufactures and  distributes premium branded photographic and video equipment  such as tripods, bags, filters, LED lights, lighting controls and  lighting supports for professional users and imaging enthusiasts.  It also supplies an expanding range of accessories for  smartphones, action and VR cameras, and drones. Addressable market  We estimate that the addressable market for products manufactured by Vitec’s  Imaging Solutions Division is worth around £800 million annually. Professional  users account for approximately half of this market and consumers make up the  remainder. There is growing adoption of new image capturing devices by  professionals and advanced consumers as the distribution of images via social  media continues to grow rapidly. Vitec is focusing on the opportunity to develop   and commercialise innovative, high end accessories for these new applications.   We sell our products globally via multiple distribution channels as well as online   via our own direct e-commerce capability 06 The V itec Group plc           Group products, developing synergies between  Vitec brands. Examples include a SmallHD monitor  with a built-in Teradek Bolt wireless receiver,   a SmallHD Focus monitor with an Anton/Bauer  battery, and a Manfrotto/Wooden Camera Directors  Cage for DSLR and mirrorless cameras. We remain  focused on further cross-selling of brands across  the Group, especially to our Independent Content  Creator customers. We also continue to identify  acquisition opportunities to address new areas   of the content production value chain.   4. Get closer to our customers We continue to drive initiatives to get closer to our  customers by owning more of our distribution and  optimising our e-commerce activities. Our end  markets are changing with more independent  content creators looking to purchase equipment  online and we are investing in and optimising our  e-commerce capabilities through working with our  major customers like Amazon and other specialised  e-tailers, and by further developing our own online  platforms. Our Creative Solutions Division has  invested in a number of “Customer Experience  Centres”, tying our many Creative Solutions brands  together to offer bundled products as well as  educational workshops.   5.
