SIR GEORGE BUCKLEY CHAIRMAN Smiths Group plc  Annual Report 2017 11 STRA TEGIC REPORT As individuals or as companies,  we can either create the future or  we can be visited by it – and who  is to say that if we just wait for it,  whether we’ll like that future visit  when it arrives?  It’s clear from the challenging experiences  of many great companies in recent years,  that unless we prepare properly for the  future, the one we want probably won’t be  there when we need it. It reminds me of  the old saying “the best time to replace  the roof is when the sun is shining.” Choosing our future There are, in fact, many possible  ‘futures’ that can be created for a  company. So it’s far better that it’s  one we intentionally design ourselves,  rather than an accidental one we may  not like when it arrives. 14 CHIE F E X EC U T I V E’S R E V IE W S U S TA IN A BLE G R O W TH A ND AT TR A C TI V E  R E T UR N S A R E W H AT W E’R E A B O U T.

FY2017 performance We delivered a good performance in  FY2017, with underlying revenue broadly  in line with the prior year. We saw growth  across the portfolio offset by John  Crane’s oil & gas business and in Smiths  Medical due to market challenges in
