However, while our funeral business continued to set the standard  at the premium end of the market, having commented  on an acceleration in market share decline in our 2016 Annual Report, market share continued to decline at an accelerated rate in 2017 reﬂecting further increases in competition. As a consequence, the Board has taken decisive action to change the Group’s pricing strategy  and market positioning in our funeral business. Underlying operating proﬁt increased three per cent to £104.6 million (2016: £101.7 million), with each operating division trading in line with the Board’s expectations. Alongside this, we continued to invest to support the existing network, acquire well reputed businesses and develop new crematoria. Change of pricing strategy and market positioning As the Chairman has set out in his statement, the Board took decisive action in January 2018 to protect market share in our funeral business and reposition the Group  for future growth. In addition to the pricing changes already implemented,  we will test a range of new price points and services to  our clients while preserving our unrivalled levels of service. Delivering excellent client service remains a key strategic priority and means that we can oﬀer the best quality service at each price point and market segment in which we choose to operate. We are now positioning ourselves  as the best value service provider in the market, leveraging the strong investment in the funeral business that we have made over the years. In addition to these changes, we have also embarked on a rigorous review to ensure that our funeral operations are organised to run more eﬃciently and eﬀectively. Having delivered the market’s ﬁnancial expectations for 2017 our results for 2018 are less certain as we gauge client response to various pricing scenarios
