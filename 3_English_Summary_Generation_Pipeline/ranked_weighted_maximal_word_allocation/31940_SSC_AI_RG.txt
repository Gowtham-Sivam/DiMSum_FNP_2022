As set out in more detail in the Chief Executive’s  Statement on pages 8 to 10 and the Financial Review  on pages 26 to 29, the Group has delivered a resilient  set of results with marginal growth in underlying  profit before tax and earnings per share. These results  are positive in the context of an uncertain political  and economic climate experienced in the year,  together with the changes within the automotive  industry, as many of our customers plan for an  increasingly electrified future. The strategy of the Group has been established  on the need to have a diversified business, both  geographically and across market sectors. It is  through the implementation of this strategy in recent  years that the Group has been able to deliver these  results, with strong performance from our Rail and  Environmental consultancy businesses, together  with our Performance Products business. After an  unsettled start, the Group saw increasingly strong  order intake as we progressed through the financial  year, including electric and hybrid vehicles within our  Automotive business, ending the year with a record  order book overall for the Group. The Group continues to pursue its strategic  objectives through organic growth and carefully  targeted acquisitions. The Group’s performance  against its strategic objectives is outlined on pages 14  and 15. We also continued to invest in research and  development (as described on pages 24 and 25), our  people and our facilities. People I would like to thank all of our employees for their  hard work and professionalism over the last year.  As set out on pages 30 and 31, Ricardo is a people  business and our employees underpin everything  that the Group achieves. We are extremely pleased  The Group continues to pursue its strategic objectives through organic growth  and carefully targeted acquisitions within Transport & Security, Energy, and  Scarce Resources &
