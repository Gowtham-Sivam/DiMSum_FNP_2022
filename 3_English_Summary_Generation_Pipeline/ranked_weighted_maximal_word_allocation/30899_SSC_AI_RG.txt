Leo Quinn Group Chief Executive Group Chief Executive’s review balfourbeatty.com/AR2017 Governance Financial Statements Other Information 05 Strategic Report These strong results demonstrate the  transformation being delivered by the  Build to Last programme. Today, Balfour  Beatty is well placed to drive sustainable  proﬁtable growth, underpinned by a strong  balance sheet. It has strength and depth  in leadership, a new, positive culture is  being embedded and the business is well  positioned in each of its chosen markets. The Group reported an underlying proﬁt  from operations (PFO) of £196 million  (2016: £69 million) driven by material year- on-year improvements in all earnings-based  businesses. Both Support Services and  US Construction reported PFO margins  in the range of industry-standard margins.  UK Construction continues on its positive  trend, with a proﬁt from operations of  £16 million (2016: £65 million loss). The Group is on track to achieve industry- standard margins in all of its earnings- based businesses in the second half of  2018 as it continues to drive three key  levers for improved ﬁnancial performance:  ﬁnalising the remaining historical contracts  through to completion; reducing costs and  raising productivity across its operations;  and executing on the improved quality of  the order book. Cash remains the Group’s focus and  ultimately the most important barometer of  ﬁnancial performance. During the year, the  Group had average net cash of £42 million  (2016: £46 million net debt); at year end,  the Group had net cash of £335 million  (2016: £173 million). The year end ﬁgure  includes £103 million received from the  sale of a 12.5% stake in Connect Plus,  the company which operates the M25  London orbital motorway. The Directors’  valuation of the Investments portfolio  has remained unchanged at £1.2 billion  (2016: £1.2 billion), despite the Connect  Plus M25 partial disposal, as a result of the  continuing strong market for secondary  infrastructure assets and the recent  favourable 06 Group at a glance Balfour Beatty is a leading  international infrastructure  group, providing the structures  and services that underpin daily  lives, support communities  and enable economic growth.
