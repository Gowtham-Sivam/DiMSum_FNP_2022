 Commercial highlights • Sustainable growth in profitability in line with expectations:  – Organic growth, contribution from acquisitions and  foreign currency translation gains, more than offset   the expected softening of Nitrile latex margins. • Europe and North America (ENA) momentum  underpinned by volume and margin improvement:  – Underlying operating profit at £117.1m increased  25.5% (2016: £93.3m) due to volume and margin   growth, the acquisition of Oxo Belgium (‘Speciality  Additives’) and foreign currency translation gains.  – IFRS operating profit at £77.5m increased 2.8%  (2016: £75.4m).  • Asia and Rest of the World (ARW) in line with  expectations in challenging market environment:  – Underlying operating profit lower by 27.9% at £35.1m  (2016: £48.7m) mainly driven by expected lower unit  margin in Nitrile latex.  – The demand for Nitrile latex continues to grow at 8-10%  pa, with market demand exceeding 1,000ktes in 2017  – IFRS operating profit down 61.6% to £31.2m  (2016: £81.3m) principally reflecting significant  income from land sales in 2016. • M&A activity:  – 2016 PAC (Dispersions) acquisition fully integrated and in line  to deliver expected $12m run rate synergy savings at the end  of 2018, and a likely further $2m saving by end of 2019.  – Acquisition and integration of Speciality Additives, a  market leading performance additives business serving  the decorative and industrial coatings industries, for an  enterprise value of €78m in March 2017.  – Bolt-on acquisition of the BASF Austrian SBR business  and assets in Pischelsdorf, Chairman’s statement Governance highlights  + Full compliance with applicable UK Corporate  Governance Code  + Positive feedback on externally facilitated  evaluation of Board and Committees  + Review and approval of Modern Slavery Act  statement and tax strategy  + Well prepared for forthcoming governance  changes Results  Following consecutive years of strong profits growth in 2015 and  2016, I am pleased to report that Synthomer has made further  progress in 2017. Consistent with our expectations, the improved  Underlying profitability of the Group has been delivered, with  incremental profits from our focused M&A activity in 2016 and 2017  and continued organic growth from our investment in our Europe  and North America (ENA) segment more than compensating for the  reduced, but stable, Nitrile latex margins in our Asia and Rest of the  World (ROW) segment. Volumes were higher by 9% to 1,443.8ktes  (2016: 1,324.9ktes) with the increase reflecting a combination of  underlying growth and additional volumes from Oxo Belgium  (Speciality Additives), which was fully integrated during 2017.  Acquisitions helped Group revenue to increase by 42% to a record  £1,480.2m (2016: £1,045.7m), further supported by higher average  raw material prices and favourable currency translation.  Underlying profit before tax increased from £122.2m to £130.0m, an  increase of 6.4% and 3.0% on a constant currency basis. The rise in  Underlying profit before tax reflects underlying volume and margin  growth, the contribution made by Speciality Additives and the  depreciation in Sterling. IFRS profit before tax Chief Executive Officer’s review Strategic highlights  + Solid and sustainable earnings growth in line   with expectations  + Integration of two bolt-on acquisitions.   PAC (Dispersions) and Speciality Additives  successfully completed  + Launch of SyNovus ®  our innovative patented   next generation Nitrile latex   + Achievement of 20% sales from products  launched in the last five years  + Largest capital expenditure programme in the  Group’s history, initiated in 2016, progressing   to plan and on time to contribute from Q4 2018  + Strong balance sheet (leverage 1 times net debt:  EBITDA) providing flexibility to pursue our strategy I am pleased to report that we have delivered solid growth in  Underlying profitability in 2017, with the strong growth in ENA profits  more than offsetting the softer but stable ARW profits.  The strong growth in ENA Underlying profitability was underpinned  by further organic growth, particularly in our SBR business, the  benefits of our focused M&A activity and the associated synergies in  2016 and 2017, and the depreciation in Sterling which favourably  impacted our first half results. ARW Underlying profitability has been  resilient, and performed in line with expectations, with Nitrile latex  margins broadly stable throughout 2017 at similar levels to the last  quarter of 2016. Positively, and as guided at the start of 2017, the  overall Underlying profitability of the Group has moved forward in  2017 with the combination of underlying organic growth, M&A  activity Strategy at a glance 18  Synthomer plc Annual Report 2017 Strategic priority Description 2017 achievements Key performance indicators 2018 priorities Risk 1   Research and  development  and technical  expertise to  exploit new  markets We anticipate market trends and  customer requirements to deliver  improved products with improved  margin and product differentiation.
