The performance has been good in all  operating divisions in the Company and  excellent progress has been made  against our strategic objectives.  I have been particularly impressed by the  pace of change in the business in recent  years as the team modernise the pubs  and brands portfolio and innovate to  address the continuous challenge to  enhance the customer experience.  Our growth primarily comes from  reinvesting year after year in our core  business and from driving ever greater  efficiency and excellence in execution.  This year has been notable for TO DRIVE FOOTFALL TO 11 www.shepherdneame.co.uk 10 Shepherd Neame annual report and accounts 2017 This has been an exciting year of  development for the Company, with good  progress in all areas of the business, a  strong underlying performance and some  great acquisitions that add real value to  the Company. We have successfully pursued our  strategy to drive long-term value for   our shareholders based around four   key objectives: • To drive footfall to our pubs •  To develop our offer to enhance   the customer experience •  To create demand and build  awareness for our brands •  To attract, retain and develop   the best people It is this consistent strategy that has  enabled the Company to outperform   the national market year after year   and to excel on a local basis. We have  modernised and improved our business  such that the profile and quality of our  pubs and brands have been greatly  enhanced and the offer and experience  for our customer transformed.  Furthermore, as our heartland of Kent  enjoys the benefit of infrastructural  development and the regeneration of the  coastal areas, our strong local knowledge  enables us to exploit the opportunities  that arise. Whilst the weather conditions have been  favourable during this year with a long  hot summer in 2016 and plenty of  sunshine in the spring of 2017, market  conditions have become progressively  harder, as consumer spending is being  squeezed by inflation.  Nonetheless, we have achieved  impressive like-for-like sales growth in   our managed estate of +8.1% against the  Coffer Peach Tracker Index* of +1.4%
