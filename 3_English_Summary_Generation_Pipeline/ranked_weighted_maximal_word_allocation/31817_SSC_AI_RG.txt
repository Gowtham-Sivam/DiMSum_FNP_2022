This has been a challenging  year, with slower than anticipated adoption of the  Company’s cadmium-free quantum dots (“CFQDs”)  in the display industry. However, significant progress  has been made in developing demand for our  CFQDs; an increasing number of manufacturers are  now producing demonstration displays incorporating  our technology and we are confident that sales will  result as these move into commercial production.  We are also making good progress in Life sciences  and Specialised lighting. The slower than expected  progress in Display and the Company’s funding  horizon have both had a detrimental impact on  the Company’s share price. I am pleased to say  that the recent announcement of an equity  placing has alleviated liquidity concerns.  MAKING STRONG  PROGRESS CHAIRMAN’ S S TATEMENT I am confident about the relevance of our technology  in display and other markets. Summary  • An increasing number of manufacturers  are now producing demonstration displays  incorporating our technology.  • We now have the supply chain and the  technology to support the development  of the emerging market in CFQDs for  the display industry. STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 05 Nanoco Group plc – Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Following the change in commercial strategy in  the previous financial year, substantial changes  were made in the Pages 14-15 06 Strategic report ENHANCING  OUR EXPERTISE CHIEF EXE CUTIVE OFFICER’ S S TATEMENT We have made substantial changes in our approach to the  business which underpin our confidence in future success. Summary  • We have developed a substantial pipeline  of commercial opportunities in Display and  in June secured the important milestone  of our first commercial sales orders.  • New production methods have achieved a  substantial reduction in costs while increasing  the productivity of installed capacity. Overview While the Group has not met the commercial  targets we set ourselves a year ago, we have made  substantial changes in our approach to the business  which underpin our confidence in future success.  We have implemented an enhanced go-to-market  strategy, invested in manufacturing capability and  received our first commercial sales orders, all against a  backdrop of growing global interest in our technology.  The evolution in marketing strategy for the display  industry, initiated in 2016, has enabled the Group to  accelerate the roll-out of its technology. We have  moved from an exclusive licensing model with Dow  to a hybrid model, combining multiple non-exclusive  licenses with direct sales of own manufactured product.  In August 2016, we announced that we had signed  up Merck as a second licensee of our technology.
