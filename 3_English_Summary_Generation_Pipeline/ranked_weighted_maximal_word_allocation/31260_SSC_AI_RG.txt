Improvement in Operational  Performance • Generated £292m in revenue which  puts the Group approximately 16%  ahead of 2016, thanks to an exceptional  performance from our people during the  year. • The adoption of IFRS15 in next year’s  annual report is expected to result in  restated revenue of circa £300m and  profit and total comprehensive income  of around £7.2m for 2017, primarily  due to restricted recognition of variable  income on legacy contracts in earlier  years. Further details of the expected  transition can be found in note 1. • Our cash balance as at 31 December  2017 stood at £17.01 million, an  increase of £5.60 million from 2016. • Current order book for construction in  2018 stands at approximately £299m,  which is just over 90% of the revenue  expectations for the current year. *  Underlying profit is profit before tax, excluding legacy contract losses of £7.29m (2016: £3.85m). Legacy  contracts are construction contracts entered into at the height of the recession, before 31 December 2013,  and which carried a high commercial and contractual risk. These contracts have negatively impacted the  Group’s income statement in 2013 and subsequent years. ** Net cash is cash at the bank at year end less any obligations under finance leases. 01 North Midland Construction PLC Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2017 OVERVIEW 25748  5 April 2018 11:24 AM  Proof 14 Chairman’s Statement 08 Market Review 10 Our Business Model 14 Chief Executive’s Statement 16 Our Strategy 19 Key Performance Indicators 26 Chief Executive’s   Statement John Homer | Chief Executive Overview of the year It is disappointing that the focus on a healthy underlying Group  performance from continuing operations appears to continue to  be diverted by the outcome of the remaining legacy contract.
