Building on the strength of our brand  and our reputation with customers  and Universities, we entered our first  on-campus University partnership with  Aston University and secured two further  development-led University partnerships  with Oxford Brookes University and in  London with planning support from  King’s College, London.  Financial performance has again  been strong, with a total accounting  return of 14% and growth in EPRA earnings,  up 12% to £70.5 million. Profit before tax  was £229.4 million, which includes property  revaluations and disposal profits of £169.2  million (2016: £201.4 million and £136.3  million respectively). As a result of this  performance, we are declaring a final  dividend of 15.4p to deliver a total dividend  of 22.7p for the full year, an increase of 26%  year on year. Unite Students is a service brand and the  strong performance we have delivered  for our customers, University partners and  shareholders is only possible because of  the talent and hard work of our teams  across the business. On behalf of the  Board, I would like to thank them for  another excellent year. I would also like to take this opportunity to  pay tribute to one of our Directors, Manjit  Wolstenholme, who sadly THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT FOR STUDENTS DELIVERING 14 THE UNITE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Strategic report I am pleased to report another strong set  of results for the year ended 31 December  2017 . We have maintained our focus on  delivering sustainable growth in recurring  profits and cash flows over the long term,  and on delivering a Home for Success for  all the students who live with us. We do this  by providing great service and operating  brilliant buildings, designed specifically for  students. Our investment discipline ensures  we maintain a robust capital structure and  deliver high-quality earnings. Performance in 2017 resulted in  another year of growth in EPRA earnings,  like-for-like rents and development profits.  EPRA earnings increased by 12% to £70.5  million and now represents one-third of total  shareholder returns. The focus on delivery  of the ongoing earnings performance of  the business is increasingly underpinned  by University backed contracts giving us  the confidence to increase our dividend  pay-out from 75% to 85% of EPRA EPS  in 2018. We will continue to focus on growing  earnings, both in absolute terms and as a  proportion of our total return. This is driven  by our ability to maintain full occupancy,  to continue growing rental levels on an  annual basis, the consistent focus on cost  efficiencies and from the completion of  our high-quality development pipeline.
