 Highlights of our year Products We manufacture our own products in our specialist facilities  worldwide, as well as sourcing from over 400 partners. This way  we   are   able   to   offer   scientists   the   newest   and   best   research   tools  available globally regardless of source. Customers Our   customers   are   research   scientists   who   need   high   performance  products   with   detailed   technical   specifications.   Our   information-rich  products,   together   with   expert   customer   support   and   fast   delivery,  Chief Executive Officer’s review Our strategy leads to long-term  sustainable growth continued We   have   delivered   strong   revenue   growth,   with   all   geographic  areas and main product categories performing at levels  above   underlying   market   growth   rates.   In   a   year   with   political  uncertainty in large markets such as the US and Europe, our  business has remained focused on serving customers well.  Our history and strengths in digital marketing continue to  support our business well and we are making increasing  use of data to enhance our product selection, website  and marketing in order to attract new customers and  satisfy more needs of our existing customers. Our research use-only product catalogue revenues  at reported values grew to £202.5m (FY 2016: £159.0m),  a 27.4% increase over the previous year. By product type,  we   continue   to   grow   primary   antibody   revenue   ahead   of   the  global   market   growth   rate.   Our   market   leading   recombinant  antibodies, including RabMAb ®  rabbit monoclonal antibodies,  are major contributors to that success. Constant currency  revenues from RabMAb ®   products   are   in   line   with   our   full   year  expectations, growing by over 25%, and now represent  £41.5m of our total £159.8m primary research antibody  revenue. With over 11,000 RabMAb ®  primary antibodies  in our catalogue, 10,000 of which are recombinant, these  and other recombinant antibodies are expected to continue  to play an important part in our future growth. Product quality is a priority for our customers and, therefore,  a   major   focus   of   our   work   and   investment   at   Abcam.   We   are  investing to increase the standards and breadth of product validation,   including   over   900   products   that   now   benefit   from  market leading knockout validation. Our investments in the  latest antibody production technology mean that our 10,000  recombinant antibodies ensure the highest standard of  repeatability for researchers and drug development teams.  We continue to work closely with our suppliers to ensure  that they meet our high standards. Non-primary antibody revenues on a constant currency basis  grew 16%, aggregated across several product categories.  Kits and assays are the largest sub-category within this part  of our product portfolio, representing approximately 60% of  the revenue. Following the mid-year revision to lower growth  targets for this portfolio, the products performed within our  expectations and all product categories within this group  grew at double-digit levels versus the prior year. Kits and assays remain a very important growth opportunity  for Abcam. These products contain all the reagents researchers  need to run an experiment and save researchers considerable  time. For example, our SimpleStep ELISA ®  kit reduces the time  it takes to run the simple ELISA experiment from approximately  four   hours   to   just   ninety   minutes,   with   the   added   benefit   that   the kit minimises potential variability between experiments.  We are investing and innovating to move our market leading  antibodies into these products as rapidly as possible. In the  last   year,   we   have   created   new   assay   products   from   integrating  antibody and assay technologies from our recently acquired  companies. These combinations resulted in the introduction  of approximately 500 new products including matched  antibody pairs, singleplex immunoassays, and multiplex  immunoassays using the FirePlex ®  particle platform.
