The Group delivered an outstanding  performance in 2017 , increasing  profit before taxation by 44% (50%*)  to a record £40.6m (2016: £28.1m).  All of the Group’s regions delivered  increases in both gross profit (net fee   income) and operating profit and 71%   (2016: 69%) of the Group’s net fee  income is now derived from overseas  businesses.   Revenue was up 17% (14%*) to £1.2bn (2016:   £1.0bn) and net fee income increased by  24% (20%*) to £345.2m (2016: £278.3m).  Operating profit was up 60% (54%*) to  £41.9m (2016: £26.2m) and earnings per  share increased by 55% to 42.9p per share  (2016: 27.7p per share).  The Group further strengthened its balance  sheet with net cash of £31. 1m as at 31  December 2017 (31 December 2016:  £22.5m). The Group’s ratio of permanent  and contract recruitment net fee income  is 68% permanent to 32% contract (2016:  69%:31%). During the year, headcount increased by  17% to 3,793 (2016: 3,229). Headcount  investment is highest in those regions and  business units demonstrating the strongest  potential for accelerated growth. The Board will be recommending a 50%  increase in the final dividend to 9.3p per share   which combined with the interim dividend  of 2.75p per share would result in a 42%  increase in the total dividend to 12.05p   per share (2016: 8.5p).  In 2017, the Group purchased 2.1m shares  at an average price of £3.79 for £8.0m, which   were subsequently cancelled. An additional   0.4m shares were purchased at an average  price of £4.03 for £1.8m through the Group’s  Employee Benefit Trust. The Board is  authorised to re-purchase up to 10% of  the Group’s issued share capital and will  be seeking approval for the renewal of this  authority at the Annual General Meeting   on 17 May 2018.

ROBERT WALTERS CHIEF EXECUTIVE STRATEGIC REPORT DIRECTORS’ REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Annual Report and Accounts 2017  Robert Walters plc 7 The Group’s ability to deliver its   best ever performance was, once  again, testament to the success   of our long-term strategy for growth;   founded on the two pillars of  international expansion and  discipline diversification.  Our international footprint covers 28   countries, and most crucially, encompasses  some of the world’s fastest growing and  exciting recruitment markets as well as more   mature and well-established locations that  continue to have significant scope for  additional growth.  The breadth of solutions we can provide to  our clients, from permanent, contract and  interim recruitment through to recruitment  process outsourcing is also a key point of  differentiation in our ability to provide a true  end-to-end recruitment offering to both  candidates and clients. ASIA PACIFIC   (40% OF GROUP NET FEE INCOME) Revenue was £370.2m (2016: £348.6m),  net fee income increased by 16% (11%*)  to £136.6m (£131. 1m*) (2016: £1 17 .6m) and  operating profit increased by 21% (14%*)   to £17.7m (£16.8m*) (2016: £14.7m). One of the key strengths of the Group is its   presence in both established and emerging   recruitment markets and nowhere is this more   prevalent than in Asia Pacific. The Group  operates in 13 countries and has an  unrivalled footprint across the region.  In Asia, the Group’s most profitable single   country, Japan, enjoyed yet another record   year in both Tokyo and Osaka, reinforcing  our market-leading position in this exciting   market. Hong Kong, another of the Group’s   well-established scale businesses, also had   a record year whilst market conditions  in Singapore remained more challenging.  Across our emerging markets, all businesses   delivered record performances and  continued to grow net fee income   and market share. Australia had a good year and a particularly  strong fourth quarter: benefiting from our  footprint of offices covering five states,  our focus on margin growth in the SME  market and high growth disciplines such  as technology, digital and contract. New  Zealand had a record year with the Group’s  successful sponsorship of the recent British  & Irish Lions Tour helping to further build our  brand profile and market-leading position.
