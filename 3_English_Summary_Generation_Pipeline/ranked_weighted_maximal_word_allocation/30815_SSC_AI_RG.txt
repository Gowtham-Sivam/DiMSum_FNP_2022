While our financial Key Performance  Indicators will focus on all value drivers,  further to the strategy review there is   a clear and increased emphasis on cash  generation and returns. These financial   and capital allocation priorities have been  aligned to new metrics for both short   and long-term management incentives,  upon which we have already consulted   with shareholders and are subject to  approval at the 2018 AGM. People and culture Change for the better is still change, which  can be disconcerting for those involved.  Accordingly, on behalf of the Board, I would  like to thank all our employees for their  continued commitment to building a better  Essentra together. We are proud of our  international presence in 33 countries and  we recognise the vital contribution which  our people make. Indeed, during the course  of the year, I had the pleasure of visiting   a number of our facilities – from our head  offices in Milton Keynes, UK and Chicago,  US and our Health & Personal Care  Packaging sites in Portsmouth, UK and  Charlotte, US, to our Components  European manufacturing hub in Kidlington,  UK and our Filter Products joint venture in  Dubai – and can testify to the skill, Review on pages 10 to 17 .

In summary, following a period of  turbulence, we did much in 2017 to  stabilise Essentra; this was not only with  regard to our operational performance  metrics, but also in terms of starting   to win back lost credibility with our  customers, improving engagement   with our employees and creating a stable  balance sheet supported by markedly  improved cash flow control. At the same  time, we have developed and articulated   a sustainable, data-driven corporate  strategy which will see the various  activities which comprise the Essentra  Group restored to profitable growth over  the medium term behind a talented and  engaged workforce. At the heart of this  change programme is our people, where  the establishment of an agreed set of  principles and the absolute priority of  health and safety have been critical  developments in the culture of excellence  which we
