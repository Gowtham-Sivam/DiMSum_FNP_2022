OUR BUSINESS AND STRATEGY Hansteen is a leading owner and asset  manager of a very diverse portfolio of European  industrial property, mainly located in Germany,  the UK and the Netherlands. We look for  investments that are priced attractively and  which will create a sustainable and high-yielding  industrial property portfolio. We also assess  other more opportunistic and management  intensive acquisitions which, although lower  yielding, will provide greater potential for capital  growth. Our strategy is achieved through a  detailed assessment of opportunities in the  UK and Continental Europe. In many cases  our purchases are ‘off market’ and can involve  patiently assembling or reconciling stakeholder  interests in a deal. Our acquisition of the HBI  portfolio in the Netherlands is a good example  of this.

We endeavour to buy assets when  they are at a relatively low point both in relation  to the property cycle and at the asset level.  In particular, we like to buy properties with a  vacant element. We then apply our particular  brand of intensive management to increase the  occupancy, increase the rent and reduce the  irrecoverable costs. Ideally, we then crystallise  the value added at a relatively strong point in  the cycle. In the years 2008 to 2013 the markets were  both depressed and distressed. During that  period we acquired £1 .6 billion of
