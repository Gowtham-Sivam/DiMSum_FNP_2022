The EweMove franchise model  combines the recruitment of local property experts (“LPEs”),  typically serving micro territories of 20,000 households through a  centralised 24/7 technology platform, with the traditional features  of a full estate agency service and a consumer fee predicated   on completed sales, rather than listings. It has been the UK’s   “No 1 Most Trusted Agent” on Trustpilot since 2016. 46 offices 186 offices 1978 year  established 19 offices 1850 year  established 13 offices 1948 year  established 19 offices 1867 year  established 1986 year established Lettings national lettings focus Sales national sales focus 120 franchisees 2013 year established 04 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strong progress despite   market headwinds All of our brands increased revenues year-on-year.   This growth was supported by the “assisted acquisitions”  programme , which assisted our lettings agents both  operationally and financially to purchase independent  competitors’ lettings businesses. In the first full year of  the programme we added 2,012 tenanted managed  properties. I’m delighted to report that this was matched  by an almost identical increase in our managed portfolio  through organic growth.  Tenant fee ban The Government has provided a degree of clarity on its  intention to ban tenant fees in England & Wales. A ban   in Scotland has been in existence since 2012. The intention appears to be an outright ban, rather than  a cap, on landlords and their letting agents charging any  type of pre-tenancy fee. It’s not clear whether certain  in-tenancy fees will be allowed. The timing of the implementation of the ban appears   to be Q1 2019 which means that the Group’s trading for  2018 would be unaffected by the ban. The Group is  already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban  which is expected to put at risk 16% of lettings revenue, and at a Group level 9% of total  revenue, if annualised*. Mitigation factors include;  through organic means and by acquisition, accelerating  the size of the tenanted managed portfolio, developing  income from financial services & conveyancing referrals.  The Group will continue to closely monitor any  developments associated with the Tenant Fee Ban   and the associated potential impact. Brand website redevelopment One of our objectives when we purchased EweMove was  to translate some of its digital marketing capabilities into  better performance for our traditional brands. During  2017 we re-developed each of our five traditional brand  websites, starting with Whitegates. Although the  technology platform is common, the look and feel of  each site is different, to reflect the heritage and values of  the particular brand. There is divergence on functionality,  with Whitegates embracing all of the tried & tested  EweMove concepts such as web pages optimised for  lead conversion, Google “pay-per-click”, “live chat”,  downloadable property valuations and functionality   to book a valuation appointment. Overall, the website  project generated nearly 17,000 new business leads   at an average cost to our franchisees of £24 per lead.   The Board believes that the new websites delivered   a competitive advantage in H2 2017. Name change On 16 March 2017 the Company changed its name from  MartinCo PLC to The Property Franchise Group PLC.   It was time to recognise the transformation from a single  franchisor to a multi-franchisor of residential agents. Outlook The Group’s intention is to be well-positioned for all  eventualities and developments in the estate agency   and letting agency space. Despite the market challenges,  the Group delivered another strong set of results in this,  its fourth full year on AIM. My thanks go to the executives, their teams and my  fellow Board members for their outstanding efforts over  Chairman’s statement 05 The Property Franchise Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2017
