Spain We build high-quality homes 6  Taylor Wimpey plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 Strategic Report and embed these new initiatives into our standard operating processes and  culture. It is here that I would like to take the opportunity to thank each and  every employee on behalf of our shareholders and the Board for all their efforts  in this area. I have been impressed by the hard work and commitment shown  by all of our teams. While we recognise that we don’t get everything right and  there is still, of course, more work to do, it has been very pleasing to see a  significant improvement in our customer satisfaction scores in recent months,  which validates the investments and efforts we have made into enhancements  in this area. We will be prioritising further improvements in customer service  in 2018.  It is, however, equally, if not more important, to acknowledge, reflect on and  address situations where we have not always got it right. Following concern  expressed by some customers, during 2017 we carried out a review of  historic lease structures and, in particular, ten-year doubling ground rent  clauses, which we had stopped using on new developments from late 2011.  Whilst Taylor Wimpey implemented these leases in good faith and the terms  were clearly set out in the relevant leases, it was clear from our review that   the impact of these doubling rent review clauses was causing some of   our customers understandable concern, particularly from a mortgageability  and saleability perspective. We acknowledge that the introduction of these  doubling clauses in 2007 was not consistent with our high standards of  customer service and we have quite rightly apologised to customers for   the unintended consequences and concern that we caused. In our Annual  General Meeting trading update of April 2017, we announced that we   would make a provision, before tax, of £130 million in the first half accounts   to allow 12 14 16 Interest Rate 0 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% UK London % of take home pay  Interest rate %   11 taylorwimpey.co.uk “  2017 has been another strong year  for Taylor Wimpey as we made good  progress towards our medium term  financial targets and improved our  operational performance. ” 2017 was another strong year for Taylor Wimpey and we enter 2018 in a  good position with positive forward momentum. We have been encouraged  by early trading patterns at the start of the year and despite some wider  macroeconomic uncertainty, consumer confidence remains robust and  market fundamentals are solid.  We grew volumes to nearly 15,000 homes during the year and are focused   on delivering much-needed homes across the UK to the highest quality and  standard. Importantly, we are pleased to see that our investment in customer  service has resulted in a notable improvement in our customer  satisfaction scores. Group financial summary Group revenue increased by 7.9% to £3,965.2 million in 2017  (2016: £3,676.2 million) from 14,688 completions (2016: 14,112). The  increase was driven by increased completions and improved selling prices  in the UK. We delivered a gross profit for the year of £1,033.0 million  (2016: £939.9 million), 9.9% up on the prior year and a profit, before  exceptional items, for the year of £660.3 million (2016: £589.7 million),   12.0% up on the prior year due to the improvement in the operational   result, lower net finance costs and lower effective tax rate. Profit for the year  was £555.3 million (2016: £589.3 million). This represents improved underlying  trading offset by the exceptional provision recognised in the year in relation to  the leasehold review.
