As an established, relationship-driven  consumer finance provider, we focus  on responsible lending and fair, helpful  service to meet the needs of customers  with complex credit histories throughout  the UK. What We Do Our customers are usually ineligible  for credit from mainstream lenders.  By offering small, affordable loans of  up to £1,000, either in cash or on a  Morses Club Card, we proudly provide  our customers with an essential service. The Group is currently in the process of  obtaining its full regulatory permissions  with the Financial Conduct Authority  (FCA) and continues to operate  under interim permissions. We operate  primarily via a network of self-employed  agents from the same communities as  their customers. Loans are finalised in  person by a Morses Club agent who  then collects the repayments each  week. These personal connections allow  us to know our customers and their  needs, developing strong relationships  that often endure for many years.  Treating Customers Fairly We are a responsible lender and our  commitment to fair customer treatment  is woven throughout our business.
