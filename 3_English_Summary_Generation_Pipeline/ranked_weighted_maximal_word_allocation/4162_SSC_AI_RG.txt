To supplement IFRS reporting, we also present our results on an
underlying basis to show the performance of the business before
separately disclosed items. These are detailed in note 5 to the Financial
Statements and principally comprise intangible amortisation for acquired
businesses, impairment of goodwill, certain costs arising as a direct
consequence of the pandemic and onerous contract charges in respect
of driver shortages in North America. In addition to performance
measures directly observable in the Group financial statements (IFRS
measures), alternative financial measures are presented that are used
internally by management as key measures to assess performance.
Further explanation in relation to these measures can be found on
pages 291 to 292.

We are well placed to drive and to
benefit from the modal shift from
cars to mass transit
Modal shift to mass transit will be the single most important driver of reduced emissions and congestion and government policy
around the world is increasingly committed to public transport – promoting modal shift away from cars onto buses, supporting
passenger growth for years to come.

Evolving
Society

Supportive
Governments

Changing demographics impact demand for public
transport. For example:

Government support for cleaner, greener, more liveable and
sustainable places

• Younger people are less likely to drive, with a
report suggesting that US Millennials are 8%
less likely to drive than Generation X, and 9%
less likely than Baby Boomers

Governments around the world are increasingly implementing
policies which promote greater use of public transport,
and funding Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) to meet their
decarbonisation and clean air targets:

• Older people need more access to healthcare
