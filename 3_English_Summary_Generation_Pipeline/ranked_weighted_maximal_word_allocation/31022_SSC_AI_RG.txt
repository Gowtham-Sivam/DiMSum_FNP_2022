Prevalence
• Asthma is a significant health burden of considerable  
and growing significance with increasing urbanisation
7
 
• Estimated 10m adults under the age of 45 affected in Europe
9
 
and 18.4m adults in the US
9
• Prevalence continues to increase and it is estimated that  
by 2025 asthma will affect more than 400m people globally
10
• Asthma aff ects people of all ages but most frequently begins 
in childhood
11
• Patients with uncontrolled asthma are significantly  
more likely to suffer from poor outcomes and  
medical emergencies
• Asthma caused 383,000 dea ths in 2015

ASTHMA
Asthma is one of the most common non-communicable diseases.1
Asthma is a chronic, reversible disease that inflames and narrows airways in 
the lungs, causing wheezing, chest tightness and coughing.2 Not all asthma  
is the same and severe asthma can have a number of underlying causes.3
Symptoms
• Recurring attacks of breathlessness and wheezing that 
vary in severity and frequency from person to person
5
• Asthma attacks – a sudden worsening of symptoms,  
can be unpredictable
• During an asthma attack, the lining of the bronchial 
tubes swell, causing the airways to narrow and 
reducing the flow of air into and out of the lungs
6
14%
of the world’s children experience asthma symptoms12
40–50%
of patients are not well controlled
14
; poor 
adherence to treatment and device user errors 
contribute to lack of control 
15
By 2025 the total asthma market is expected  
to be worth over
$17bn

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and 
treatable disease that is characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow 
limitation that is due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by 
significant exposure to noxious particles or gases. COPD is not curable, but treatment 
can relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and reduce the risk of death.

 and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
predicts that COPD will be the third leading cause of 
death worldwide by 2030
