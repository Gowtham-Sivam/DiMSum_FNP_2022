Michael Cunningham Non-executive Chairman Summary • Loss before tax and impairment of  £406,000 (2016 profit: £1,336,000) • Adjusted net asset value at  £1.60 per share (2016: £1.96)  • Five acquisitions in 2017 added  £4.4m of capacity to 2017  underwriting year – 13% increase • 1.5p per share total dividend  payable (2016: 5.5p) Your Board announces the results for 2017  which were affected by the underwriting losses  arising from natural catastrophes that occurred  in 2017 and by the reduction in the value of  the syndicate portfolio of capacity. The loss  before impairment for the year is £406,000  (2016 profit: £1,334,000), whilst the adjusted  net asset value of the Group is £1.60 per share  (2016: £1.96). The full impact of the 2017 losses on the Helios  portfolio of £5.8m was mitigated by the use  of quota share and stop loss reducing the net  loss for 2017 to £1.9m. Underwriting profits from the two older  underwriting years, the “off-risk” years, made  a good contribution but the 2017 underwriting  year in its first 12 months recognised a  significant loss following the series of natural  catastrophes in the second half of 2017.  Other income arising from fees from  reinsurers, recoveries from reinsurance  policies and investment income have  contributed to this year results. Total  costs of £1.8m included the expenditure  on protecting the portfolio using stop loss  reinsurance and foreign exchange losses  from the strengthening of the US$. Strategy The building of a portfolio of participations on  leading Lloyd’ s syndicates remains the strategic  objective of the Group. During 2017 the key  developments were: Chief Executive’s review Opportunities in the future Acquisition strategy continues   to build the fund of capacity Nigel Hanbury Chief Executive Summary • Adjusted net asset value at  £1.60 per share (2016: £1.96)  • Five acquisitions in 2017 added  £4.4m of capacity to 2017  underwriting year • 1.5p per share total dividend  payable (2016: 5.5p) We have continued  to implement our  strategy of building  the portfolio of  syndicate capacity. Highlights • The strategy of building a quality  portfolio of syndicate capacity continues  successfully as the portfolio increased  from £32.6m to £41.0m – a 26% increase  • The use of quota share has provided  finance for acquisitions and has mitigated  the loss from 2017 catastrophe losses • The reduction of the value of the capacity  portfolio to £13.0m (2016: £14.9m) will  provide opportunities to acquire further  LLVs at reduced prices • Helios’ portfolio underwriting results for 2015  underwriting year outperformed Lloyd’s  return on capacity by 6.6% demonstrating  the quality of the portfolio • Market conditions for underwriting  are improving after the 2017 losses • With the prospect of improving  underwriting returns, together with the  opportunity to acquire LLVs at lower  values, Helios is well placed to deliver  value to shareholders in the future Capacity value The value of the portfolio of the syndicate  capacity remains the major asset of the  Group and an important factor in delivering  overall returns to shareholders. The adjusted  net asset value (“ANAV”), being the value of  the net tangible assets of the Group, together  with the current value of the portfolio capacity,  is a key management metric in determining  growth in value to shareholders.  The Board had recognised that the average  prices derived from the annual capacity auctions  managed by the Corporation of Lloyd’s could  be subject to material change if
