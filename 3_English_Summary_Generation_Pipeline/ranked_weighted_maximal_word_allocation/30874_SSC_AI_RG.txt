We have since grown side-by-side with our country  throughout its economic and political development. As Georgia  lacked a functioning financial system at the time of TBC Bank’s  inception, we became true pioneers in establishing a well-run  banking institution with a long-term perspective. We set ourselves a challenging task: to build a banking business  that would earn trust and credibility with our customers. For that  reason, from the outset, we adopted a customer-centric approach  in our business. To help achieve our goal, we have sought to  employ people who share our mindset and have created a strong,  committed team with common values. Over the past 25 years, TBC Bank has been growing together with  its customers, supporting them in meeting their financial needs,  helping them to achieve success and contributing to the entire  country’s development. Today, we take pride in being the largest privately-owned bank in  the region 1 . In addition to our strong team spirit, we attribute our  continued success to having one of the most recognised brands in  Georgia, a superior customer experience, the best multichannel  network and a full range of innovative services and products. Strategy We believe that TBC Bank’s future success depends on its digital  competence, as customers are increasingly shifting towards digital  banking. The banking industry is entering a digital era and we need  to stay abreast of upcoming changes. Last year , we announced an  updated strategy to become the best digital financial services  company in the region 1 . We remain committed to this strategy.
