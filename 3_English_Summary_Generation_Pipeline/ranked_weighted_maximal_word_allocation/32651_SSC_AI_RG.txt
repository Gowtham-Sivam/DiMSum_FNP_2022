Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) • Customer loss and competition  There is an ongoing risk of customer loss from  enhanced competition. The Group‘s strategy is  to maintain customer loyalty through: 1) offering  consistently high quality products at consistently  low prices, customers can rely on us to be significantly cheaper  than our competitors. • Food Safety  Compliance with legislation is continually assessed  with a rolling monthly internal Food Safety  compliance audit in each store augmenting the  annual Environmental Health Office inspections.  Any performance exceptions are discussed as a  matter of course at the Monthly Plc Board meeting. • Environmental risks  The Group places considerable emphasis upon  environmental compliance in its business and not  only seeks to ensure ongoing compliance with  relevant legislation but also strives to ensure that  environmental best practice is incorporated into its  key processes. • Major disruption/disaster  Business continuity planning is reviewed regularly. • The effect of legislation or other regulatory  activities  The Group monitors forthcoming and current  legislation.  • Shrinkage  All retailers are exposed to customer and employee  theft. The Group has a zero tolerance to theft and we  continually review internal systems and controls. We  maximise the use of CCTV surveillance in store and  aim to prosecute where relevant.
