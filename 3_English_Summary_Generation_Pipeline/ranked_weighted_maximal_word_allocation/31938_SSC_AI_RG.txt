A significant  proportion of this has come from  recurring revenues from the core  telecoms towers business, DTT platform  and radio contracts, and the Group’s  smart metering network. Added to this  we’ve seen greater revenues driven by  customer improvement programmes,  specifically accelerations to 4G  equipment upgrades to assist MNOs in  meeting coverage requirements, and  meter sales in relation to the smart water  metering contract with Thames Water.  Satellite and Media benefitted from new  HD channel sales, a new agreement with  Al Jazeera Media Network for global  teleport distribution services and foreign  exchange gains. The visibility of revenues with a  contracted order book of £5.7 billion,  inflation-linked pricing, and the  opportunity to increase utilisation of  our infrastructure, places Arqiva in a  very strong position to continue to  deliver stable profitable growth. Our  on-going and significant investment  in digital broadcast infrastructure; 4G,  5G, in-building solutions and small  cells underlines Arqiva’s commitment  to support the UK’s ambition to have  a vibrant and globally competitive  economy. Alongside our growth strategy, our  transformation programme, ‘FutureFit‘,  is lowering our cost base; streamlining  processes, modernising and making  our systems more robust, resulting  in improved customer service and  operational delivery. Operational delivery  We have continued to successfully deliver,  to our clients satisfaction a number of  large-scale projects which leverage our  tower infrastructure, including smart  energy and water metering.  During the year our smart energy  metering contract for the North of  England went ‘live’ bringing new, and  recurring, revenue streams into the M2M  business. The rollout of the network  is currently at 92% coverage and the  rate of rollout to consumers’ homes is  expected to accelerate over the next 12  months following service user testing.  Following the excellent delivery and  results on the smart water metering  contract with Thames Water, our  customer has taken the decision to  accelerate their network deployment.  This will help to achieve coverage of 3  million homes several years earlier than  originally planned in order to realise the  benefits of extended coverage sooner.  The Group is progressing with the DAB  rollout programme for the BBC, and has  completed upgrades to the
