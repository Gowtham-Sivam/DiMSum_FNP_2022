Customer   George Banco. Non-Standard Finance plc Annual Report 2017 4 Chairman’s statement 2017 results The Group’s performance in 2017 was ahead  of our original expectations, driven by a  strong performance from Everyday Loans  and also by a sharp uplift at Loans at Home  which benefited from operational  challenges at a major competitor. It also  includes a maiden contribution from George  Banco whose results were consolidated from  the middle of August 2017. Reported revenues were £107.8m (2016:  £72.8m) and the Group produced an  operating profit of £3.8m (2016: operating  loss of £5.2m). Higher interest costs and the  impact of exceptional charges resulted in a  reported loss per share of 3.26p (2016: loss  per share of 2.60p). On a normalised basis and excluding  temporary additional commission, the  Group’s underlying performance was strong,  delivering a 35% increase in pre-tax profit to  £16.4m (2016: £12.1m) and earnings per share  of 4.25p (2016: 3.09p). Strategy Our strategy remains unchanged. We  remain focused on serving the needs of  consumers who are unable or unwilling to  borrow from mainstream institutions through  three distinct business divisions: branch- based lending, home credit and guarantor  loans. Each of these segments offers  significant opportunity for growth and  having already achieved our target of 20%  loan book growth across the Group as a  whole, we remain on course to also deliver a  20% return on assets in each of our  operating divisions. This will be achieved  through the execution of the three elements  of our business strategy: • Being a leader in our chosen markets;  • Investing in our core assets; and  • Acting responsibly.
