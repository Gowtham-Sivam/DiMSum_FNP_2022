 Directors and Advisers IBC www.dillistonegroup.com 01 GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS STRATEGIC  REPORT Commenting on the results and  prospects, Mike Love, Non-Executive  Chairman, said: “The current trading performance of  the Group is positive with orders for  both Dillistone Systems and Voyager  Software ahead of the same period  in 2017 – with the former more than  25% up on the same period in 2017  and the latter having one of the best  quarters for new business orders in   its history.  Our GatedTalent product, launched  in October 2017, has been very well  received with a growth trajectory that,  we believe, will lead to it becoming the  dominant product in its market space  within a year.  Recurring revenues for 2017 were at  record levels and, despite the ongoing  investment in product development,  cash reserves have held up well.  Overall, despite the evident pressure  on new licence sales in 2017 and the  loss for the year of £0.071m, going  into 2018 the Group believes that it is  now in a stronger position in its core  markets than in recent years.  This confidence in the future allows  us to recommend a final dividend  of 0.5p and we anticipate reporting  further positive progress as the year  progresses.” OVERVIEW  ❯ Record level of recurring revenues 1 , of £7.474m, up 6% from 2016 with total revenue down  4% to £9.582m  ❯ Recurring revenues, representing 78% of Group revenue, covering 97% of Group  administration expenses before acquisition related and one-off costs  ❯ GatedTalent launched in October 2017 and which made an operating loss of £0.439m  ❯ Adjusted operating profit 2  fell to £0.309m (2016: £1.463m) before acquisition intangible write  offs and an adjustment for the loss of a contract in our Voyager division which totalled £0.823m  pre-tax  ❯ Loss for the year of £0.071m (2016: profit £0.526m)  ❯ Adjusted basic EPS 3  of 3.08p (2016: 7.10p)  ❯ A final dividend of 0.5p per share recommended (2016: 2.8p)  ❯ Cash funds at 31 December 2017 of £1.390m (2016: £1.537m) with borrowings of £0.391m  (2016: £0.158m)  ❯ New GatedTalent platform grows rapidly, with more than 160 contracted search firm clients   by 26 April 2018 and first revenues in 2018  ❯ Executive membership on the GatedTalent platform is both senior and diverse with CEO,  Managing Director and General Manager being most frequently referenced current position   and members registered from 75 countries.

It is through their efforts, commitment and  determination that we continue to be a leading  technology provider in the sectors we serve.  On behalf of the Board I would like to take this  opportunity to thank all of our staff for their  individual and collective contributions during  2017 and for the huge effort demonstrated  during the early months of 2018, supporting  our GDPR related projects. Outlook Both our Dillistone Systems and Voyager  Software divisions have enjoyed strong demand  for our products and services during the first  quarter of 2018. The Board is delighted to note  that, while Voyager revenues will clearly be  impacted by the previously announced loss of  a legacy contract, Q1 2018 saw one of its best  ever quarters in terms of new contract wins. After a slow January, orders for Dillistone  Systems’ FileFinder product improved  significantly in February and March and ended  the quarter more than 25% up on the same  period in 2017. Many of these orders were  driven by demand for our GatedTalent product  which features exclusive integration with  FileFinder Anywhere. In our 27 February announcement, we  revealed that we had achieved the milestone  of 100 clients for our GatedTalent service.  We continue to see strong demand for the  platform, with more than 160 firms having  now signed contracts. The division has now  generated its first subscription revenue. Long term revenue growth from the  GatedTalent platform will be derived from  interactions with executives who register with  the service and create a profile. Executives  join to be “On the radar” of our executive  recruiter clients.
