Effective from 23 February 2017 our business has been further  simplified into three divisions: Risk &   Compliance £42.3m (2016: £38.8m) Revenue  This division includes Wilmington’s  financial training businesses, financial  networking events and our repositioned  legal product Chairman’s Statement I am pleased to present my report on  Wilmington’s results for the twelve months  ended 30 June 2017. Overall It has been  a positive financial performance as we  move towards our objective of becoming  a single integrated international business.  Wilmington has continued to meet  the challenges that necessary change  inevitably brings; a balance of growing  revenue and profits whilst making material  investments in new products, systems,  offices, personnel and in new businesses.  Wilmington delivered revenue growth  of 14% (up 9% on a constant currency)  led by excellent contributions from the  acquisitions made during the year and  supported by organic growth from our  core offerings. We have seen strong  growth from Healthcare up 28% and  good growth from Risk & Compliance up  9% as well as growth from Professional  which increased its revenue by 7% albeit  benefiting from the acquisition of SWAT.  Adjusted profit before tax (which now  for the first time includes share based  payment costs of £0.6m (2016: £0.6m))  increased 5% to £21.4m (2016: £20.3m).  Business strategy Wilmington’s strategy is to further  develop its business into a knowledge  based model and structure focussing on  serving the needs of chosen communities  with an overall objective of becoming a  single integrated international business.  This business structure will maximise  Wilmington’s opportunities to help its  clients and communities meet their  information, education and networking  requirements as well Chief Executive Officer’s Review 25570-4   AR2017  27 September 2017 10:58 AM   Proof 4 Compliance  Our compliance business which accounts  for just over 50% of the division’s revenue  grew by 10% compared to 2015/16 (4%  constant currency). However, within this,  our compliance training businesses which  are the division’s main engine of growth,  grew by 12% (8% constant currency)  slightly down on our expectations due  to some slippage of assignments into  2017/18.  Compliance Week, our US Governance  Risk and Compliance (GRC) events and  information business reported revenue up  16% and on a constant currency basis  revenue was flat. There is an ongoing  programme of investment in new content  and technology to reposition the business  as a GRC resource centre and events  business collaborating with other parts  of Wilmington, in particular ICT and  ICA but also FRA on joint events. The  flagship event in Washington held in May  2017 enjoyed continued success and  again attracted record delegates and  sponsorship offsetting some decline in  subscribers and sponsored events in  the rest of the business. For 2017/18  continued investment is being made to  strengthen the content offering and more  topic areas will be added together with  supporting databases.  Risk Axco, the industry leading provider of  insurance market intelligence, regulation  and compliance information reported 8%  revenue growth (3% constant currency)  helped by the continued success
