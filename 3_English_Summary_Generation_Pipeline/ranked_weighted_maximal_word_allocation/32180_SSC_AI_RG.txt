Telford Homes is skilled in all aspects of  London development and we can apply our  knowledge and expertise to a wider range   of opportunities in new boroughs.  We develop in non-prime locations to  maintain an affordable price point for our  individual customers and our strategic move  into build to rent provides scope to work  with investment partners across London.

Our ability  to deliver forward sold homes to our customers  on programme, together with a step change in our  presence in the build to rent sector, saw Telford  Homes achieving excellent results for the year to  31 March 2017.  I am particularly pleased that we  achieved a 99 per cent customer recommendation  rate in 2016, a notable endorsement of our  commitment to quality and service.  Since February 2016 we have exchanged contracts  on four significant build to rent transactions with  a range of investors, indicative of our growing  reputation in the sector as a trusted delivery partner.   Along with monitoring external influences on the  Group, the development of our build to rent strategy  has been one of the principal areas of focus for  the Board this year.  This sector complements our  historic focus on individual sales to investors and  CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW DEVELOPING IN LONDON:   A POSITIVE OUTLOOK Our forward selling strategy continues to be at  the heart of our model. We sell homes early in the  development cycle as a means of de-risking projects  and advancing investment into new opportunities.  This means that trading activity undertaken in each  financial year will typically deliver revenue and profit  over the following two to three years, giving the  Board substantial visibility over future profit levels  and expected cash flows. We receive deposits when  contracts are exchanged for individual properties  and, as at 31 March 2017, £68.1 million of deposits  had been taken in advance of future completions.  This additional funding supports further investment  in the development pipeline and reduces the need to  draw down debt finance. We start the financial year  with a substantial order book of forward sales of  £546 million (1 April 2016: £579 million). This secure  and de-risked position is underpinning our stated  expectations for growth over the next few years. Following some recent land acquisitions, our  development pipeline stands at £1.5 billion of future  revenue and represents more than five times the  revenue generated in the year to 31 March 2017. The  average anticipated price of the open market homes  within the pipeline is £527,000 (2016: £513,000).  This is in line with our model of seeking non-prime  opportunities where the average sales price is below  £1,000 per square foot, and hence the majority of  homes are priced between £350,000 and £700,000. OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 15 KEY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW In February 2017, we added to the pipeline with  the acquisition of a sizeable development site, the  former London Electricity Board (LEB) building on  Cambridge Heath Road, E2 for £30.2 million. The  anticipated gross development value of the site is  approximately £95.0 million. Subject to planning  consent, we expect to start work on site in 2018 and  to finish in 2021. Post year end we have exchanged  contracts to acquire Stone Studios in Hackney  Wick for 120 homes plus commercial space, and  have been selected as the preferred partner of the  London Borough of Brent to develop 236 homes in  South Kilburn. Both sites have full planning consent  and we expect to start on site later this year. Customer mix The Group’s customer mix for the year to 31 March  2017 has moved significantly towards institutional  build to rent investors, with this sector representing  77 per cent of
