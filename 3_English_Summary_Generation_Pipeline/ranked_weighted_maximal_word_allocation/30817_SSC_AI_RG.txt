See pages 174 to 178. 2 From continuing and discontinued operations. Strategic Report  Chairman’s Statement 3 Chairman’ s  Statement 2017 was another successful year   for the Group.  The US B&GA market grew strongly during the year and we have  continued to lay the foundations for further growth and value  creation across the Signature network through investing in our  infrastructure and customer offer and successfully negotiating  revised commercial terms with many of our customers. We made further investments in Ontic’s IP-protected licence  portfolio in 2017 and the business performed very strongly, with  good contributions from new licences and growth from military  parts programmes. There was a much improved operating  performance at ERO despite challenging markets.  During the year we undertook a comprehensive review of BBA  Aviation’s capital structure and, as a result, have increased our  targeted leverage range. This enables us to maintain a capital  efficient balance sheet, based on the strong and robust cash flow  fundamentals of the Group, and provides us with the flexibility  required to meet investment opportunities to fund organic and  inorganic growth and enhance shareholder value. Results Continuing Group revenue increased by 10% to $2,370.6 million.  Flight Support revenue was up 13.8% and Aftermarket Services  revenue grew 3.1%, driven by Ontic which offset the decline at ERO.  Continuing Group underlying operating profit was $360.6 million  (2016: $302.6 million) and continuing Group underlying operating  profit margin increased to 15.2% (2016: 14.1%) reflecting underlying  margin growth at both Flight Support and Aftermarket Services. Underlying continuing profit before tax increased to $298.5 million   (2016: $238.7 million) and adjusted continuing underlying EPS was   up 24% to 24.0¢. We delivered free cash flow of $220.6 million   (2016: $224.1 million) and, as a result, the Group de-levered to   2.6x net debt to underlying EBITDA on a covenant basis. Return on  invested capital (ROIC) was up 90 basis points to 11.0% (2016: 10.1%). Dividend The Board is proposing a final dividend of 9.59¢ per share, taking  the full year dividend to 13.40¢, an increase of 5%. This reflects the  Board’s progressive dividend policy and its continued confidence in  BBA Aviation’s future 4  “ I have greatly enjoyed this  period as Interim Group Chief  Executive. I am extremely  proud of our people – their  energy, their commitment,  their integrity and their focus  has established the momentum  that we take into 2018.”  Wayne Edmunds,  Interim Group Chief Executive Q&A with Interim  Group Chief  Executive  Q. How would you describe current US B&GA market conditions? A. The B&GA market is looking positive. It showed good growth in  2017 – in the USA growth was 3.1% in the first half and 4.1% in  the second – and, as we look into 2018, we are encouraged by a  positive outlook for the US economy, with expected continued  growth in GDP underpinned by tax reforms. Within the different  customer segments, charter traffic demonstrated particularly  strong year on year growth.   In the first half of the year, Signature grew in line with the market  despite the short-term impact of combining the two commercial  books of Landmark and Signature and transitioning key customers  onto new commercial agreements. In the second half, we  outperformed a more buoyant B&GA market as the new commercial  agreements bedded down and new traffic patterns established.  Q. What is the enlarged Signature network capable of? A. Signature now has 198 locations across the world. Of the top 200  B&GA airports in the US, Signature is present at locations where  68% of fuel is burned, and we are located at key B&GA centres  outside the US, in Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. These  are in the places that our customers want to fly to and where they  know they will receive the same industry-leading service from our  highly trained Signature team. We have built relationships with these  customers and we continue to invest in the quality of experience and  in the quality and range of our infrastructure, our service offering  and our technology, so that they continue to choose Signature. Our  goal is to continue to grow operating profit ahead of the market. Q. How
