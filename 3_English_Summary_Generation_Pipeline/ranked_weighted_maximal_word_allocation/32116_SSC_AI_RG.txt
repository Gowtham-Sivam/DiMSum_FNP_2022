It is great to be back at a business I served for  more than a decade. Importantly, I would like to pay tribute to the  achievements of my predecessor, Sir Charles Dunstone, one of the UK’s  great entrepreneurs, who founded half of this business that has gone on  to be one of the world’s major retailers, serving millions of customers  every year in 10 countries and employing more than 43,000 people. It has been a remarkable and sometimes challenging year.  In the days after the referendum on the UK’s membership of  the EU, the Company’s share price fell by as much as 34%,  as retailers were considered vulnerable to a post Brexit  slowdown. In this environment and despite the uncertainty,  the team got on with their job of making the business  stronger by serving our customers better.  In the UK & Ireland our new 3-in-1 stores bring together  Currys, PC World and Carphone Warehouse in an exciting  shopping environment and we are very pleased with the  initial results of these stores. We have also improved  our online capabilities, particularly with a new Carphone  Warehouse web platform and we have experienced strong  online sales growth across all our brands.  And it’s not just about great products. Team Knowhow, our  new services brand, is piloting a range of expanded services  in the Leeds and London conurbations. We think that this  support will be ever more important to help customers  to get the best from the amazing world which modern  technology can offer.  We also have become an important centre to help  customers choose the best providers of other services.  We successfully integrated Simplifydigital into the Group  and both in store and online made switching your energy,  broadband or TV service easy.

In what continues to be a lively political environment, in particular  in the UK, it has been good to see the business deliver a good year for  Dixons Carphone both financially and operationally. Dixons Carphone has had another strong year financially;  Group like-for-like revenues were up 4% over the year,  with growth in every region in the Group leading to a  10% increase in Group headline PBT from £457 million to  £501 million, slightly above the guidance we gave, resulting  in an increase in headline basic EPS from 30.2p to 33.8p.  At the same time, it is pleasing to see – across the Group  – sustained high levels of customer satisfaction and Net  Promoter Scores driven by our continued relentless focus  on improving our proposition for our customers. Total  reported profit before tax has increased by £123 million  driven by the increase in headline EBIT and a reduction  in year on year non-headline costs, principally those  associated with our ‘big-box’ property plan, the costs of  which were fully recognised in FY16. Our business in the UK & Ireland enjoyed a good year  despite some headwinds in particular within phone, with  like-for-like revenues up 4% over the year and headline  EBIT up 4% to £385 million. This sales growth was driven  in large part by growth in electricals in a flat overall market.  This was somewhat tempered by a more challenging phone  sector which was impacted by product safety issues, a  limited supply in the market of some key lines and some  changing trends in SIM-only. Against this backdrop, the  team have delivered good profit growth underpinned by  solid cost control across the business.  Over the course of the year we all but completed our  ‘big-box’ property plan, closing 80 stores, and providing  a consistent experience with the latest categories and  look-and-feel now right across our estate.
