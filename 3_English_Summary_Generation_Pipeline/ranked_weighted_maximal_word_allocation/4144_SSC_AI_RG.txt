About us
What we do and why
We’re a world leading supplier of measuring systems and production systems.
Our products give high accuracy and precision, gathering data to provide
customers and end users with traceability and confidence in what
they’re making. This technology also helps our customers to innovate
their products and processes.
We are guided by our purpose: Transforming Tomorrow Together. This means
working with our customers to make the products, create the materials,
and develop the therapies that are going to be needed for the future.
We believe that our purpose is incredibly relevant in today’s environment
where the pace of change in technology is faster than ever. We also know
that the future will be a world of scarce resources, needing high-performance,
intelligent, personalised solutions that make the best use of these resources,
and our expertise can help deliver this.
Our vision is to innovate and transform the capabilities of our customers
and end users through unparalleled levels of:
Precision

Productivity

Practicality

How we do it
While our vision sets our direction, our strategy is our route to getting there,
and we set this out on pages 18 to 21.
Our purpose, vision and strategy are supported by our values. Our values
guide the way we behave and the decisions we make, both as a business
and as individual employees. Opposite, we explain each of our values and
hear what they mean to some of our people.

Our values
Innovation

Integrity

We encourage our people to be
innovative and challenge convention.

We should act with integrity at all times.

Innovation is a mindset, of continually
challenging processes, products and systems,
professionally and in everyday life.”

When we hold each other to account, we value the
commitments we make to each other, and we keep
ourselves collectively on track. Integrity can be hard
but it’s worth it.”

Joel Canty

Greg Nixon

Innovation goes beyond our products. In my team,
we always look to improve the way we do things
and the processes we use every day.”

During last year’s formal sale process I saw a very
strong drive to make sure that we communicated –
within the rules – to employees about some of the
key developments. That, to me, was also a real sign
of integrity because some companies would not
have felt compelled to do that, but Renishaw did.”

Inspiration

Involvement

We should aim to inspire each other,
our customers and the people we
work with outside of the business.

We encourage everyone to be fully
involved and to support each other
in contributing to the success of
our business and the communities
we operate in.

Inspiration works both ways; sometimes each of
us is a source of inspiration, and we can draw it from
our colleagues and customers, getting ideas and
motivation from them.”
Enrico Orsi

Whichever part of Renishaw you work in,
you’re involved. We all make a difference.”
Steve Oakes
UK

I really think that it’s very important to get ideas from
your colleagues and to learn from other cultures.”

I think that everyone’s opinion counts and is valuable.”

Industrial Metrology

Neurological

Products include our measurement systems for
co-ordinate measuring machines (CMMs), gauging
systems, and probes for use on machine tools
such as lathes and milling machines. We also sell
styli, the part of the measuring system that makes
contact with the measured parts, and fixtures that
help secure those parts in place.

Products include our drug delivery system, which
helps treat neurological conditions, and our
stereotactic robot that’s used in neurosurgery.

Spectroscopy
InVia Ramen

0

Position Measurement
Our encoders are devices which give fast feedback
on linear and rotary positions of machines.
Our calibration products help manufacturers know
whether their machines are working as intended.

microscope

Our Raman spectroscopy systems analyse
materials in the laboratory and in the field.
The systems help gather chemical and structural
information, which customers use to identify the
materials in a sample.

Additive Manufacturing (AM)
Our Additive Manufacturing machines use laser
powder bed fusion to create metal 3D parts from
digital files. Thin layers of material are used to
create complex shapes that cannot be produced
by traditional manufacturing such as casting,
forging and machining.
