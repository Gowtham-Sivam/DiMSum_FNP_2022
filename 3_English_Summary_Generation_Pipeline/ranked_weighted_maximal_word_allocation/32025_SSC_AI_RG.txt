 CONTENTS OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS  » Feeds – headline operating profit of £1.5 million  (2016: £2.1 million). Good second half recovery,  having been impacted by margin pressure due to  increased commodity costs, particularly through  the winter months. Volumes were robust and the  mill developments in the North and Cheshire,  completed during the year, have strengthened  our operating platform.  » Food – headline operating profit of £3.0 million  (2016: £2.7 million). A strong result built on  efficiently delivering increased activity levels with  the business operating at capacity throughout  the year.  » Fuels – headline operating profit of £4.5 million  (2016: £3.9 million). Strong volume growth across  the depot network and the new depots in the  South East exceeded expectations in their first  full year.

Over the last ten years we have seen solid  progress from the Group with revenue up from  £361 million to £556 million, headline profit before  tax up from £4.0 million to £8.5 million, headline  earnings per share up from 5.8p to a record 14.0p  this year and dividend per share up from 3.9p per  share to 6.0p per share. Over the same period net  debt has fallen from £52 million to £13 million. During the year, strong performances from  Food and Fuels more than offset the challenging  conditions experienced in the Feeds market.  Food remained at full capacity, operated efficiently  and delivered more loads whilst maintaining  service levels at 99.7%. Fuels increased volumes  significantly, more than offsetting the impact of the  mild weather in the first half with growth across the  depot network and the successful development  of our cold starts in the South East. Feeds volumes  were stable, with growth in line with the market but,  with increasing commodity costs, margins were  under pressure and the business was not able  to fully pass on these increases during the year.  The capability of the Group to deliver sustainable  growth whilst experiencing tough trading  conditions due OVERVIEW STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW How does Brexit impact NWF? We are a UK business, with three divisions which  all performed well in the global financial crisis as  they supply basic products to meet the country’s  needs for Feeds, Food and Fuels. We have not  seen any changes in the demand for our products  and services to date and monitor the situation closely. Who are your largest shareholders? We have no shareholders greater than 5% but a  number of significant pension funds and investment  funds below 5% with whom we meet regularly. Which is your favoured division? All three businesses are unique and deliver benefits  to shareholders and have development potential.  In addition, through operating in three separate  markets the overall risk profile of the Group is reduced. Does the pension scheme constrain the  development potential of the Group? Our pension scheme is closed to both new  members and future accrual and is carefully  monitored by the Board and managed carefully  alongside professional advice. We have a strong  asset base and significant banking facilities to help  invest in growth opportunities. Are you just a dividend/yield stock? Whilst we recognise the value in the dividend,  we are looking to deliver total shareholder return  through a combination of share price accretion and  a progressive dividend policy. We are looking to be  strong and resilient but are also ambitious for the  development of NWF.  Is the Group
