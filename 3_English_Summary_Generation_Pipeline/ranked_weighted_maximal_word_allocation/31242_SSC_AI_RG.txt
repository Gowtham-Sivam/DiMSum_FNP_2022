One of the key features of the Investment Management Agreement with Phoenix  is that they earn no management fees other than an annual performance fee, equal  to one third of NAV per share total returns in excess of the total return of the FTSE  All-Share Index. This fee is subject to claw back and a high water mark and is capped  at 4% of NAV p.a. in the case of an absolute increase in NAV per share; and 2% in the  case of a decrease but with outperformance compared with the FTSE All-Share. Despite Aurora’s strong outperformance of the Index in 2017 , no performance  fee was earned by Phoenix. The NAV had lagged the Index in 2016 and, as the  performance fee is calculated on a cumulative basis, it can only be earned once the  lag has been caught-up. At the year-end, the “lag” had reduced to just under 5%, after  which a performance fee will be earned for subsequent outperformance. The share price of Aurora traded at a premium to NAV for substantially all of the  period in question. The average premium for the year was 1 .5%, which was helpful in  attracting new investors and to increase the size of the Company through the issuance  of new shares. Accordingly our aim is for the shares to continue to trade at a small  premium to NAV and to grow the Company further, as discussed below.  Two Years of Phoenix Management 2017 was the second full year of Phoenix management, which began with their being  appointed Investment Manager in January 2016. Aurora is managed under the same  investment strategy as Phoenix’s long standing, open-ended fund, the Phoenix UK  Fund. Since its inception in 1998 that fund has delivered, net of fees, annualised  returns of 10% compared with 5.5% for the FTSE All-Share Index. I thought it might be useful to add some observations on our experience over the  last few years of the investment management process and practices of Phoenix. Three  key words stand out in my experience: patience, discipline and focus. There’s a lot of  talk about patient capital but it seems to me that the root of long term outperformance  is the willingness to accept some periods of underperformance followed by (hopefully  more significant) periods of outperformance based on core investment principles.  The key though are those investment principles that guide the stock selection. Get  them right, wait to find the right business at the right price – as evidenced by the  recent purchase of Dignity after many years of patient research and monitoring – and  hopefully you’ll reap a long-term reward.  Discipline I think goes with patience. It’s about waiting to buy the right stock but  also it’s about using thorough processes, checklists and research gathering processes  to find the right stock. Phoenix build up the required knowledge by studying the  relevant industries and companies in detail – a learning process which can take several  years. When it comes to price, Phoenix are disciplined in only paying up to half of what  they believe the business is worth.  The last word I mentioned was focus. In the case of Phoenix this involves knowing  some sectors really very well. That requires that patience and discipline but it also  requires a willingness to shut out other ideas and stay focused on what you know –  your circle of competence. That means for instance some focus on consumer stocks  such as Sports Direct, where Phoenix have been patient and successful – in terms of  investment returns. Alternatively, it could mean a focus on housebuilding companies  or, indeed, specialist hobby brands – a niche within the consumer space arguably –  which involves outfits such as Hornby or latterly Stanley Gibbons.  There is though one side effect of what we think as the three virtues of patience,  discipline and focus – sometimes there aren’t many new portfolio additions. This  means turnover can and has been low.

I would add a final parting observation. Patience, discipline and focus can also  be applied not only to the investment process but also the way the Company is  developed over time and marketed to a wider audience. Phoenix are committed to  growing the size of the
