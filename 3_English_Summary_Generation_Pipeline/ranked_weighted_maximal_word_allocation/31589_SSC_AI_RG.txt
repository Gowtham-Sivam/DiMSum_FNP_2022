This level of commitment and passion  exists throughout Britvic and on behalf of the Board I would  like to thank all of them for their hard work. In October we  announced a proposal to close our Norwich site with the loss  of 242 roles. This was not an easy decision for the Board and  senior management team but one that we felt necessary to  protect the long-term prospects of the business. As a Board,  we are committed to treating those affected with respect and  dignity and the proposal in no way reflected their performance.  Every effort will be made to re-deploy those who wish to  transfer to other sites and we will provide every assistance  for those seeking to find new roles elsewhere. The Board Having succeeded Gerald as Chairman we have made  some further changes to the board. Sue Clark has been  appointed Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Ian  McHoul appointed Senior Independent Director whilst  remaining Chair of the Audit Committee. Both Sue and Ian  have extensive multinational experience that has benefited  the Board since they joined in recent years. In September,  Joanne Averiss stepped down from the board as the PepsiCo  nominated director. Ben Gordon will reach the end of his ninth  year of tenure in 2018 and it has been agreed that Ben will step  down in early 2018 and will not seek re-election at the AGM.  Britvic plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 09 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT CAPITALISE ON  EXISTING AND FUTURE  OPPORTUNITIES Simon Litherland Chief Executive Officer This year we have continued to make good progress delivering  our long-term strategic goals. The challenges we face in all our  markets have been well documented, however our continued  focus on meeting consumer needs, successfully executing our  commercial plans and driving cost efficiency has translated into  a strong full year performance. We have delivered revenue and  margin growth and our adjusted EBITA* increased by 5.1%,  enabling us to deliver an 8.2% increase in the full year dividend. Generate profitable growth in our core markets GB The GB soft drinks market, as measured by Nielsen, has for the  first time in several years seen value growth ahead of volume.  Thanks to disciplined revenue management we have led the  value growth in the soft drinks category and successfully  protected our profitability in response to rising costs driven  by underlying cost inflation and the weakening of sterling.  Margins improved in the second half of the year following  the implementation of revenue management changes. In the carbonates category, we have continued to focus  on no and low-sugar offerings. Despite a highly competitive  grocery market, Pepsi MAX has continued to gain volume and  value share and we have seen an excellent performance from  the R Whites brand, following the introduction of a premium  range last year. In GB stills, whilst we have seen a decline in  revenue, our performance trajectory has improved year on  year and, encouragingly, we have returned to volume growth.  Robinsons and Fruit Shoot have faced pricing pressure in  grocery, largely due to aggressive private label and branded  competition. Whilst we anticipated a weaker final quarter, it  was worse than expected due to will be introducing a Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) on drinks  with more than 5g/100ml of added sugar in April 2018.  How is Britvic helping consumers make healthier choices? Our purpose is to make life’s everyday moments more  enjoyable and part of doing that is by helping consumers  make healthier choices through making drinks that taste  great and are better for you. Since 2013, we embarked  on a bold, 3-pronged strategy of reformulation, innovation  and using the power of our brands responsibly to help  consumers make healthier choices. As a result of our  actions, we have removed over 20bn calories from our  portfolio since 2013 on an annualised basis.
