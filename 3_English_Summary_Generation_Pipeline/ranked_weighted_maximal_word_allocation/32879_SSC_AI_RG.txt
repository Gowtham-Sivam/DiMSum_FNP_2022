ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2017 12 OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW PENSIONS  Our pensions businesses have all seen significant changes to their  modus operandi following the UK Spring Budget.  Total revenue across our pensions businesses amounted to £10.2  million (2016: £9.2 million) and accounted for 47% of total Group  revenue (2016: 52%).  As predicted since the UK Spring Budget, our Gibraltar operation  has seen almost no new business with regards to ROPS, whilst  Malta is now only receiving new business from the EEA.  Conversely, our UK SIPP business has become the focus of new  business growth. To put this in context, for the nine months following the Budget,  new business numbers were 217 ROPS (2016: 1,224) administered  by our Malta and Gibraltar offices and 755 SIPPs (2016: 162)  administered from our UK operations. Malta remains the largest of our three jurisdictions with pension  turnover of £6.1 million (2016: £6.5 million), with Gibraltar  generating £2.6 million (2016: £2.4 million) of turnover, and finally,  in its first full year under STM’s ownership, the UK generated  £1.5 million of revenue (2016: £0.3 million).  An important KPI remains the annual recurring revenue statistic  which has been determined as the contractual element of any  trustee fee due or any fees under the life assurance policies, which  are billed on an annual basis. For 2017 this amounted to £9.6  million (2016: £8.5 million) which represents 95% (2016: 93%)  of total pension revenue, giving a highly visible and predictable  future revenue stream.  LIFE ASSURANCE The acquisition of London & Colonial in late 2016, and with it  the Gibraltar based life assurance company (LCA), has allowed  STM to significantly grow its life assurance business. This is seen from the 2017 combined revenue figure of £5.9  million as compared to £2.8 million for 2016. Pleasingly, organic growth for STM Life during the year has  delivered a 26% uplift, to generate turnover for 2017 of £2.4  million (2016: £1.9 million). Within this revenue figure, recurring  revenue, annual fees and investment income amounted to £1.8  million compared to £1.4 million in 2016. This provides a steady  and highly visible annuity income stream. In addition, LCA has performed as together with the accounts of the Group  and the independent auditors’ report for  the period. These will be laid before the  shareholders at the Annual General Meeting  to be held on 23 May 2018. PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES  AND BUSINESS REVIEW The principal activity of the Group  during the year was the structuring and  administration of clients’ assets. RESULT AND DIVIDENDS The profit for the year of £3,974,000 (31  December 2016: £2,373,000) has been  transferred to reserves. In respect of the year ended 31 December  2017 an interim dividend of 0.6p per share  was paid in November 2017 and the  Directors recommend that a final dividend  of 1.2p per share be paid in June 2018.
