Glencore’s balance sheet has never been  stronger and our investment case, underpinned  by our leading marketing and industrial asset  businesses, has never been better  Capitalising on a strong   operating environment After an encouraging end to 2016,  which saw commodities recover   from cycle lows, positive momentum  continued through 2017, resulting   in prolonged outperformance of  Glencore’s key commodities versus  the broader markets. Concerns of  tightening financial conditions in  China during the second quarter  proved to be short-lived, with  commodities rallying once again  through the second half of the year. Strong economic performance  in both major developing and  developed markets has underpinned  04 Chief Executive Officer’s review 04 Glencore Annual Report 2017 Looking ahead, while we maintain  our long-term Marketing Adjusted  EBIT guidance range of $2.2 to  $3.2 billion, a continuation of recent  healthy marketing conditions would  suggest a 2018 performance in the  upper half of the range. Industrial margin expansion  through higher prices and relentless  cost focus Industrial Adjusted EBITDA of  $1 1.5 billion in 2017 was 60%   higher than 2016. Our asset   portfolio continued to deliver overall  competitive all-in unit costs which,  despite some minor production  challenges during the year, allowed  the Company to capitalise on healthy  commodity prices and generate  higher Adjusted EBITDA mining  margins of 38% and 41% respectively  in our Metals and Energy operations. Energy and mobility transformation  forecast to unlock material new  sources of commodity demand Commodity differentiation is  increasingly important, and  Glencore’s commodity mix  is becoming less dependent  on demand generated by   infrastructure related investment  in developing markets. Accelerating electric vehicle adoption  requires an energy and mobility  transformation that is forecast to  unlock material new sources of  demand for the enabling underlying  commodities including copper,   nickel and cobalt. We recently commissioned an  independent study to gauge the  potential incremental demand   for these commodities under the  Electric Vehicles Initiative scenario  of 30 % electric vehicle market share  by 2030. The findings suggest an  additional 4.1Mt of copper, 1.1Mt   of nickel and 314kt of cobalt supply  will be required by 2030.  These potentially significant new  demand sources offer compelling  fundamentals, particularly when  coupled with persistent  supply challenges.  Automaker investment in EVs:        $90 billion and counting The rate at which automotive and  battery companies have scaled up  electric vehicle investment plans  speaks to our opportunity as a  supplier of key metals.
