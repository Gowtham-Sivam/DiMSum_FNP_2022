We give people the confidence to be 
whoever they want to be...
Our guiding beliefs 
Our purpose – to give people the confidence to be whoever they 
want to be – rests on some deep-rooted beliefs. We believe in a 
world where people have the freedom to explore and express 
themselves without judgement, no matter who they are or where 
they’re from. Where people value themselves and feel proud 
of who they are. Where individuality is a source of confidence, 
because difference makes the world a better place.
This mindset guides everything we do. The huge diversity 
of our product range. The inspirational content we share. 
The people and partners we choose to work with. At the 
heart of the culture we’ve created at ASOS you’ll find 
authenticity, bravery and creativity. Our people have all 
three, and this makes our business soar.

...we want to be the world’s number 
one destination for fashion-loving 
20-somethings...
Knowing our market
Our mission is to be the number one destination for fashion-
loving 20-somethings. But we specifically avoid defining 
what it means to be number one. We believe there’s always 
more we can do, and we don’t want our mission to have an 
end point. Instead, we strive towards a goal that’s always 
pulling us forward. There’s a necessary restlessness here 
that gives us a powerful edge in our market. 
Our customers move quickly, and so should we. We operate 
in a world that’s constantly changing – fashion, technology 
and 20-somethings themselves are in perpetual motion. 
So continuous evolution and innovation is fundamental to 
who we are as a business. ASOS is a perpetual work in 
progress, but one with a very specific market focus.

DETAILED MARKET POTENTIAL BY REGION
We continue to see considerable opportunity 
for material growth across our key markets. The 
apparel market is undergoing significant channel 
shift, with growth in the online apparel market 
outstripping growth in the overall market globally. 
Expectation is that online penetration will continue 
to increase, and we are well placed to capitalise 
on this shift in customer behaviour. In the UK, 
our home market, the online apparel market has 
grown at over twice the rate of the apparel market 
across the last five years. Our retail sales growth 
has continued to surpass growth in the online 
apparel market in all of our key territories.

...our market is hugely dynamic  
and fast-paced...
Our sustained concentration on the global 20-something 
fashion and beauty space gives us a constant stream of 
potential new customers. And this market focus is one of 
our biggest strengths, playing into our strategy, style and 
communications. 
With the worldwide reach of the internet and social media 
platforms, there’s much more of a common culture followed 
and enjoyed by 20-somethings. Fashion trends happen 
around the world, rather than market by market. Celebrities 
often have global appeal. And we want to engage
