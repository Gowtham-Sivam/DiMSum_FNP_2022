From the same date, it was also  included in the EPRA indices which measure the  performance of the European listed REIT sector.  I would like to welcome all new shareholders joining  the register as a result of these significant events. On admission to the Main Market, NewRiver REIT plc  became the ultimate parent company, replacing  NewRiver Retail Limited. The change in name  reflected the combination of the Company’s  portfolio now including both retail and leisure  assets as well as its high dividend pay‑out ratio as  a UK‑registered Real Estate Investment Trust. The  core business strategy remains unchanged and the  Company continues to operate according to its strict  Paul Roy Chairman I am delighted to report that NewRiver REIT plc  (“NewRiver”) produced excellent financial results for the  year ended 31 March 2017. Funds From Operations grew  by 24% to £58 million, and the Company increased the  ordinary dividend for the period by 8% to 20.0 pence per  share (FY16 18.5 pence), as well as declaring an additional  special dividend of 3.0 pence per share. founding principles of active asset management and  risk‑controlled development. NewRiver’s specialism is owning convenience‑led,  community‑focused assets, primarily serving  family shopping and leisure requirements. Its  occupiers are, in the main, value‑led retailers,  paying affordable rents and providing shoppers with  everyday non‑discretionary items such as clothing  and groceries. From the perspective of the landlord,  this sector consistently proves itself to be a highly  resilient segment of the retail market, capable of  sustaining cash flows in most economic conditions.  The strength of the Company’s key operating  metrics demonstrated the soundness of its business  model during what was at times a turbulent year  for the retail sector generally. Notably, like‑for‑like  footfall and occupancy levels both improved  compared to the previous period. 12 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 The Company showed agility in the acquisitions  market over the year CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRATEGIC REVIEW “ Our convenience‑led,  community‑focused retail &  leisure portfolio has proved  well‑positioned in what has been  an uncertain twelve months at  the macro economic and  political levels.” This has been another outstanding year for  NewRiver, which is reflected in a strong set of full  year results. These results also demonstrate that  our focused business model, which we have strictly  adhered to since our IPO, is clearly working well. Our convenience‑led, community‑focused retail and  leisure portfolio has proved well‑positioned and  well‑placed in what has been an uncertain twelve  months at the macro economic and political levels.  As a business, we have maintained our disciplined  approach to stock selection, remained active  asset managers, progressed our risk‑controlled  development pipeline and recycled capital  profitably, all of which has allowed us to continue  to deliver growing and sustainable cash profits to  our shareholders. Our Funds From Operations (‘FFO’) of £58.2 million  were up 24% compared to the same period last  year due to acquisitions made in the last 12 months  as well as our highly active asset management  programme. The Board recently approved a final  quarterly dividend of 5.0 pence per share, resulting  in a fully covered ordinary dividend for the year of  20.0 pence per share, up over 8% compared to last  year. We are delighted to announce an additional  3.0 pence per share special dividend linked to our  acquisition in Sheffield, taking the total dividend  for the year to 23.0 pence per share, an increase  of 24%. This special dividend demonstrates our  commitment to continue to distribute growing cash  returns to our shareholders. Looking ahead, the  increase in our Q1 FY18 dividend to 5.25 pence per  share, an increase of 5% on Q1 FY17, reflects our  confidence in the security and sustainability of our  cash flows. Our assets under management now stand at  £1.3 billion, £1.1 billion at NewRiver’s share, with our  EPRA net asset value per share down marginally by  3 pence to 292 pence reflecting the absorption of  acquisition costs and Main Market move costs as  well as a small 0.6% reduction in portfolio valuation.  Importantly, this reduction came in the first half of  our financial year, when real estate values were  David Lockhart Chief Executive Officer Mark Davies Chief Financial Officer Nick Sewell Executive Committee member Allan Lockhart Property Director 14 NewRiver REIT plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 impacted by Brexit fears, and our valuations showed  improvement in the second half.
