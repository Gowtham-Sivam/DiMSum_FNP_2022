Discounters’ tissue offerings are skewed towards Private Label and this is driving  the growth of Private Label in the market as a whole. Discounters typically look   for lower prices and suppliers that offer high, sustainable volumes. Discounters  typically dedicate 3% of their shelf space to tissue products, compared to 2% in  the Multiples. The majority of Accrol’s products are Private Label.

Our revenue grew to £135.1 million,  increasing 14% compared to FY16 and in line with market  expectations. Adjusted EBITDA increased to 16.1 million, up 7%, and  adjusted profit before tax increased £4.8 million to £13.0  million, up 58%. Profit after tax has risen to £7.4 million,   up 29%. With Grocery inflation rising during the year, consumer  footfall in the Discount Sector showed no signs of  slowing down as shoppers continued to look for ways of  offsetting rising household prices and switching to lower  cost alternatives. As a result of new contract wins starting  in late 2016, our value market share in the Discount  Sector grew to over 50%, firmly endorsing Accrol as the  soft tissue supplier of choice for the sector. The year was not without its challenges. In anticipation  of Sterling weakness and volatility following the UK’s  decision to leave the European Union, we moved to  protect ourselves from adverse exchange rate  fluctuations by significantly hedging our exposure to help  mitigate raw material cost price increases. However, we  have continued to look ahead, positioning ourselves for  growth, investing in both our facilities and our team to  help us capitalise on the market opportunity.    During the year, we opened our new production facility  at Leyland, Lancashire, which gives us the opportunity to  install a total of 6 tissue converting lines and the potential  to generate revenues in excess of £100 million from the  site, and £250 million in aggregate. We currently have 2  lines installed and recently announced the addition of a  3rd line which will be installed towards the end of 2018 as  we seek to extend our reach into the Major Multiples.  We also embarked on an ambitious plan to reorganise  our warehousing and logistics operations, creating a  centralised finished goods hub next to the M58 in  Skelmersdale, Lancashire. This will enable us to better  service our customers and prepare for future growth. Accrol’s founders, the Hussain family, have now fully  exited the business in line with the strategy we set out at  IPO, and we have made a number of new senior  management hires across the business. I would like to  thank the Hussain family for a smooth and successful  transition to new management. Strategy and outlook The continued oversupply of Parent Reels shows no sign  of abating and as of January 2017, a further 111 tissue  mills were on order or in their final stages, keeping  pricing competitive and supporting our strategy to  procure Parent Reels versus own manufacture. We will  continue to source reels from around the globe, taking  advantage of new technology and spare capacity.  The majority of Private Label retail shelf prices for soft  tissue are still at pre-EU referendum levels. There are  positive signs that this is changing, albeit slower than we  expected, and we expect the industry as a whole to pass  on the effects of the weaker pound as currency  contracts unwind.  Peter Cheung Executive Chairman CONVERTING   INVESTMENT  INTO GROWTH Accrol Group Holdings plc / Annual Report and Accounts 5 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report  Key to our expansion will be to strengthen  our relationships in the growing Discount  Sector, the continued consumer shift  towards Private Label tissue products and  winning new business in the Premium Retail  Sector. Our recent investment in new  production capacity, logistics and  warehousing facilities will allow us to build  on our strong market position.
