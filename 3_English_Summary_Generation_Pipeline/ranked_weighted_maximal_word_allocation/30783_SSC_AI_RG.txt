Subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 11 May 2018, the ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 16 May 2018 to shareholders on the register at 13 April 2018. The ex-dividend date will be 12 April 2018. The Year Ahead 2018 will be our ﬁrst full year as a publically listed business. Even with our strong performance to date, we have only penetrated a small proportion of our addressable market, one that will over time become even larger with our recent entrance into overseas markets and expansion into new sectors such as the institutional and funds market.  Having invested in technology, new product development and infrastructure in 2017, along with the growth of our team, we are well positioned for further growth. Q1 has already started positively and with a clear strategy and a highly motivated team in place, I am looking forward to the rest of the year with optimism. Clive Kahn Non-Executive Chairman CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:06  Page 13 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 14 Operational Review 2017 marked a strong year of growth for Alpha, both in revenue and in our investment in staﬀ and infrastructure. During the year, we increased our client numbers by 39%, bringing our total number of clients to 310. Pleasingly, the fact that our revenue has grown at a higher percentage is a reﬂection of the larger trades that we are doing and the increasing size of our clients.  We will continue to focus on growing our client base by penetrating our existing corporate marketplace in the UK, alongside continued expansion into the institutional marketplace and overseas sectors. Europe in particular presents a very exciting area of expansion for us. During the ﬁnancial year we have recruited staﬀ for our London oﬃce who are ﬂuent in foreign languages which has enabled us to steadily expand into select European territories. As a result, we successfully onboarded our ﬁrst European clients in the second half of the ﬁnancial year. Whilst we are constantly looking for ways to acquire new clients, we remain dedicated to providing the very best levels of service to our existing client base. To ensure this, my co-founder Jon Currie has recently moved into a role focused on enhancing our service delivery and is working collaboratively with our clients to improve our customer insights and perpetuate our high levels of client retention. Further operational progress was made with the expansion of our FX Analysis team and through obtaining regulatory approval to sell derivative products. As well as providing additional beneﬁts to our existing clients, both developments will undoubtedly increase our appeal to prospective clients. Aside from penetrating our traditional corporate marketplace, we have targeted the institutional and funds marketplace, which presents a valuable growth opportunity for Alpha. As such, we have created a team with a wealth of experience in institutional FX and tailored our technology and service solutions to meet investment managers’ speciﬁc and increasingly complex needs. Throughout the course of this year we have also continued to invest in the ongoing development of our technology platform which has proved to be an important element of our advisory service oﬀering and this will continue to be a focus moving forward. Our online currency management platform has been developed in-house and we believe, aﬀords us a strong Chief Executive’s Statement “Everyone at Alpha passionately believes our IPO marked the start of our journey, not the end. We took Alpha public to avoid the ‘destination mentality’ and now have the opportunity to continue developing a very special business.” 248225 Alpha FX_pp12-pp26.qxp  03/04/2018  15:07  Page 14 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT 15 competitive advantage.
