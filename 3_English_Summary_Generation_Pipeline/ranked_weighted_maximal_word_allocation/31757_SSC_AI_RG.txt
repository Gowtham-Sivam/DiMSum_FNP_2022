Despite this, the year was also one   of investment and significant progress  towards achieving the Group’s medium  term strategic objectives. In our Agriculture division, while the UK  business benefited from a recovery in  farmgate milk prices and consequently  improved farmer confidence, sales  volumes in our USA feed block business  were affected throughout the year by  lower cattle prices. This was partially  mitigated by a gradual recovery in the  second half which has continued into  the new financial year. In October 2017  we completed the acquisition of Pearson  Farm Supplies Ltd in line with our  strategy of strengthening our presence  in current locations. With the backdrop of this recovering  USA trading environment, the strategic  investment made in our new low  moisture feed block plant in Tennessee,  USA will provide us with access to new  geographic markets in the Eastern   and South Eastern states of the USA.   The plant is expected to be completed  before the end of December 2017   and following this the Group will have  comprehensive coverage of all the major  cattle areas in the USA.  In our Engineering division, we suffered  a significant setback during the year as   a result of a delay to the commencement  of a major contract and the poor  profitability of certain other contracts  during the period. As previously disclosed  in our trading update on 20 July 2017,  the delayed contract has 10 Agriculture The Agriculture division has experienced  a challenging year. Lower farming profits  in the USA, resulting from lower cattle  prices, impacted sales volumes of our  feed blocks. However, this was partially  offset by a recovery in UK Agriculture   as farmgate milk prices and farmer  confidence improved.  FEED BLOCKS In the USA, pressure from lower cattle  prices impacted our feed block business,  with sales volumes, including joint  ventures, down 4.1% year on year.   As anticipated, the second half of the  year saw the beginning of a recovery,  resulting in volumes being marginally  ahead of previous expectations.   This gradual recovery is expected   to continue in the current year.  Our new low moisture feed block plant  in Tennessee is expected to be fully  operational by the end of December  2017, providing access to new markets  across the Eastern and South Eastern  states of the USA and providing  additional capacity as the market  recovery continues.  UK feed blocks performed well,  demonstrating the strength of our  brands, despite milder spring weather  conditions which caused a slowdown   in the second half.  Overall, feed block sales were down   2.1% on last year.  We continue to develop opportunities   to expand geographically. In South  America, our trials at FAI Farms   (a commercial research institute in Brazil)  and the Instituto de Zootecnia near  Ribeirao Preto, São Paulo State are  progressing well. Completion of the  trials is expected in the current financial  year and initial results are encouraging.  In New Zealand we have incorporated   a subsidiary company and established   a direct sales operation distributing   to farmers through key merchants   as we make progress towards
