Argentina is an extraordinary country with  a proud commercial heritage that is  blessed with a wealth of natural resources  and a skilled and well-educated workforce.  Following more than a decade of  domestic policy that stifled investment,  the current Macri administration came  into power in 2015. The new administration  is progressing a business friendly growth  agenda that has reconnected Argentina  to the international community.  Since being elected, the administration  has delivered significant advances  with regard to foreign policy, economic  normalisation and social reform. Argentina  is on a fast-track process to join the  Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and Development (OECD) and has been  designated as the G20 chair for 2018.  The Argentine Peso has been fully  deregulated with exchange controls  removed and has been freely floating  since December 2015. Revised monetary  policy has been introduced by the central  bank aimed at bringing inflation under  control and protecting the value of the  Peso over the medium to long term. The  government has introduced important  labour, tax and capital markets reforms  which are helping to attract investment,  both domestically and from abroad, and  reactivate the economy. The fiscal deficit  is being tackled and unemployment is  gradually reducing. In 2017, the Argentine  Merval Index was the best-performing  stock market index globally. The recent currency volatility and  devaluation driven by domestic  inflation concerns highlights the  challenges Argentina faces. However,  the administration’s reaction to this  recent volatility and the IMF’s positive  response is encouraging.
