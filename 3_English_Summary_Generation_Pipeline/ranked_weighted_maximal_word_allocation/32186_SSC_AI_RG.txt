The Group  has also made good progress towards its  strategic objectives and in particular, by  achieving underlying ROCE of 18.4% in  the year, ahead of target. Group revenue for the year was £271.2m,  15.0% higher than the prior year on a  reported basis, 10.6% higher on a constant  currency basis and 4.1% higher on a like  for like constant currency basis. Underlying  operating profit at £23.8m was 11.7% higher  than the prior year, mainly reflecting a further  significant improvement in performance in  our South African business, and a first‑time  contribution from Abode which was acquired  in March 2016. Underlying diluted earnings  per share was consistent with the previous  year at 27.8p. The recent acquisitions of Croydex and  Abode have been integrated seamlessly  into the Norcros Group and are performing  in line with the Board’s expectations. I have  been encouraged by the quality and  enthusiasm of the management teams  of those businesses in identifying and  pursuing opportunities in collaboration  with the Group’s existing portfolio, particularly  in the areas of new business development,  procurement and supply chain. The Group has again delivered a strong  cash performance, with underlying  operating cash flow at 99% of underlying  EBITDA (2016: 76%). The Group is in a  sound financial position with a strong  balance sheet and has reduced net debt  by £9.3m to £23.2m (2016: £32.5m),  representing leverage of 0.8 times  underlying EBITDA. Dividend The Board is recommending a final  dividend for the year of 4.8p (2016: 4.4p)  per 14 June 2017 06 Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2017 Group Chief Executive’s statement Overview Building on our record of sustained progress  over recent years, Group revenue for the  year increased by 15.0% to £271.2m  (2016: £235.9m) and by 10.6% on a  constant currency basis. Group operating  profit was £16.8m compared to £16.7m in  the prior year. Our performance in the UK in the second  half of the year was in marked contrast  to the first half, with like for like revenue  (excluding revenues from Abode entirely  and Croydex for quarter one) up 8.8% in the  second half having been down by 5.0%  in the first half against the comparative  period. The first six months were extremely  challenging, particularly in the retail sector,  reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the  implications of the EU referendum. I am  pleased that our UK businesses recovered  well in the second half of the year and were  able to capitalise on the more stable trading  environment, delivering growth in all of  our key segments of retail, trade and  export. UK revenue for the year at £182.3m  (2016: £163.0m) was 11.8% ahead of the  prior year and 2.0% higher on a like for like  basis. The like for like increase mainly  reflected the success of the recent  acquisitions, Vado and Croydex, partly  offset by the more challenging trading  environment experienced by Triton in the  first half of the year. UK underlying operating  profit for the year was £0.2m higher than  the prior year at £17.4m (2016: £17.2m) with  an underlying operating margin of 9.5%  (2016: 10.6%). The modest improvement in  profitability in the year mainly reflected the  first‑ time contribution from Abode and a  full year of trading at Croydex partly offset  by lower contributions from Johnson Tiles  and Triton, reflecting lower revenues
