We have made  significant progress in executing our  strategy of transforming the Group into  a Healthcare marketing services- focused business, helped by the  acquisition of The Creative Engagement  Group (‘TCEG’).  Our continued focus on operational  efficiencies and the elimination of  loss-making agencies combined with  strong organic growth from the  Healthcare division produced a very  strong like-for-like growth in headline  profit of 20%. We continued to refine and execute the  Group’s strategy during 2017. The  restructuring of the Group into four  principal divisions following the  acquisition of TCEG gives a better  balance to our reporting structure and  provides greater insight into the  performance of the Group. Buoyant trading in the three Healthcare- focused divisions was again led by  Evoke (within the Marketing division)  and ApotheCom (in the Medical  division), both of which had outstanding  years. I was delighted to welcome TCEG  into the Group in July, an excellent team  with a passion for their work. They bring  new capabilities in mixed media and  exhibitions to the Group, as well as  access to new types of clients. TCEG has  performed well in its first six months, it  is now fully integrated within the Group  and is increasingly engaged in joint new  business with other Group agencies. We have made significant  progress in executing our  strategy of transforming the  Group into a Healthcare  marketing services focused  business.

Red has had a good  year despite some client attrition, but  recent wins emphasise its fundamental  strength. Citigate Dewe Rogerson has  had a solid year despite difficult market  conditions in the UK and Asia. There is real momentum at Huntsworth  as all the agencies focus on what is of  most value to their clients. There is a  very different sense of what is possible  than there was just over three years ago  when I joined the Group. So it is with  much sadness that, given my other  commitments, I will step down as Chair,  subject to an orderly succession  process. After three years’ service, Tim Ryan, the  Group’s Senior Independent Director,  stepped down from the Board in  December 2017. I would like to thank Tim  for his support and help in guiding the  Group over the critical restructuring  period from 2014 to 2017. Andy Boland,  who is the Group’s longest serving  Non-Executive Director, will become the  new Senior Independent Director. We  also welcomed Liz McKee Anderson to  the Board on 1 January 2018. Liz brings a  wealth of experience in healthcare and  will be Chief Executive’s Statement Our evolving  business model  and strategy Introduction
