In the 52 weeks to 24  March 2017 sales rose by 6.7% to £5.3bn  and operating profi t rose to £176.1m.  Customer satisfaction was strong.  The fi nancial performance was good  and the Group ended the fi nancial  year with net cash of £160.7m. Our  ‘Drive’ plans are working well with  progress on the catering and retail sides  of the business. Our like-for-like sales to  caterers were up by 4.4%. Our like-for-like  sales to retailers declined by 0.6%  primarily due to tobacco legislation.  The plans to ‘Broaden’ the business  are going well. In the 52 weeks to 24  March 2017 Booker distributed £2.3bn  of product to our customers’ premises  versus £1.8bn last year as we continue  to expand our delivered service. Digital  sales were £1,072m compared to  £979m in the previous year and Booker  India is making progress.  On 14 September 2015, Budgens and  Londis joined the Group. They are  performing well. Basic earnings per share were 8.66  pence, up from 7.24 pence last  year. Given the strong operational  performance and cash fl ow of the  business the Board recommends the  payment of a fi nal dividend of 4.97  pence per share (2016: 4.03 pence per  share) which, together with the interim  dividend, makes a total dividend for the  year of 5.60 pence per share (2016: 4.60  pence per share). The fi nal dividend is  payable on 7 July 2017 to shareholders  on the register on 9 June 2017. In addition to the fi nal dividend, the Board  is recommending a special dividend  to shareholders of 3.02 pence per  ordinary share (at a cost of approximately  £54m, CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW • In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh.  Sales in the year to 24 March 2017  were £76m.  • We launched CleanPro in 2014.  This range of professional cleaning  products has been well received  by customers. We have 50,000  customers buying CleanPro each  week with sales of £44m per annum. • We continue to improve the ‘good,  better, best’ of the offer in order to  satisfy all customers. For example,  Chefs Essentials chips grew at 31%  and Chefs Larder chips at 9%. We  launched Chefs Larder Premium  Chips, these are gluten free and have  already achieved sales of £4m.  We  have won ‘Best Frozen Product’  at The Caterer Product Excellence  Awards and ‘Best Frozen Food’ at the  Wholesale Q Awards. • We have also been growing with  branded suppliers. Since November 2005 we have been  seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and Broaden’  Booker Group. 2016 was another  good  year in a challenging market Tobacco  legislation depressed our retail customer  sales and there has been signifi cant  movement in commodity prices. Despite  these challenges the Group continued  to make good progress on both the  catering and retail sides of the business. FOCUS (commenced  November 2005) Booker seeks to become the most  effi cient operator in our sector. We  continue to improve business effi ciency.  We ‘stop, simplify and standardise’ work  and invest most of the resulting savings  in customer service. We extended the  use of ‘self-scan’ and improved stock  management. Our close attention to  cash has resulted in having £161m of  net cash, whilst keeping the Group cost  base in line with last year (pre Budgens  and Londis). DRIVE (commenced March 2006) Booker Wholesale/Makro, our cash and  carry businesses had a good year. We  continue to ‘Drive’ choice, price
