 01 C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 WWW.C4XDISCOVERY.COM Our Discovery Engine Our suite of combined proprietary technologies forms the core of our state-of-the-art  Drug Discovery Engine that spans novel target identification and drug molecule design. Our vision C4XD is committed to becoming the world’s most productive Drug Discovery Engine,  supplying the pharmaceutical industry with a sustainable source of commercially attractive  drug assets. We commit our resources to the early discovery of novel therapeutic targets  for high value disease areas and generate new drug molecules against these targets rather  than competing with others by running clinical studies. We are ambitious and aim to produce  four or more pre-clinical candidates every year once the Company reaches “steady state”.  Our sustainability will be driven by licensing our assets to the pharmaceutical industry and  using the revenue generated to drive our engine harder. We continue to invest in our proprietary suite of drug discovery technologies and our highly experienced and  uniquely trained scientific team. Combined, we believe this makes us uniquely positioned to achieve our goal.  C4XD at a glance Our vision is to become the world’s most productive  Drug Discovery Engine and provide pharma with a  sustainable source of commercially attractive assets. Taxonomy3 ®  is used to analyse complex “healthy  versus disease” genetic datasets. It identifies and  characterises defined patient groups and is able to  identify previously unknown genetic linkages and  interactions between genes and biological pathways  in a broad range of diseases. T axonomy3 ®  fuels our  drug discovery portfolio by generating novel targets  in these genetically defined patient sub-groups. Our pioneering drug design technology comprises  both Conformetrix and MolPlex. These synergistic  technologies enable C4XD to enter novel chemical  space and rapidly gain knowledge about the bioactive  form required for a successful drug, allowing the  design of highly potent and selective molecules.

The pharmaceutical industry’s demand for high quality, early stage drug candidates  continues to grow and we are poised to take advantage of this growing trend by continuing  to build a focussed commercial function that continually monitors the landscape for licensing  opportunities. We only pursue new programmes in areas of high unmet medical need that  are commercially attractive and focus on generating long-term partnerships with licensors.  Revenue generated through early stage licensing deals will be reinvested into our Drug  Discovery Engine to maximise value for our shareholders. We remain on track to complete our first early stage licensing deal in early 2018.  Where beneficial we will continue to seek opportunities to build alliances with organisations that have capabilities  complementary to our own. Fast, cost-effective novel candidate discovery Well diversified multi-disease portfolio   across a variety of biological targets Focussed investment on highest value activities Long-term alliance revenue from partners Suite of cutting-edge  proprietary technologies Highly experienced  scientific team (>320 years) Industry-leading  management team and Board Proactive   commercial  capability Strategic report ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 04 Strategic report CEO’s statement Clive Dix, Chief Executive Officer This has been an important year  for C4XD in implementing our  vision as we have progressed our  pipeline towards commercialisation,  replenished our pipeline with new  discovery programmes and raised  the capital required to support  our strategy. Commercialisation During the fundraise in March 2017 we  stated that we fully expected to complete  our first commercial deal within 12 months  of that date. We believe and understand  that this is a crucial element of successful  implementation of our business model.  We continue to believe that this important  milestone will be met. Our lead programme, Orexin-1, aims to treat  addiction by targeting the “craving” process  itself and, therefore, can be applied across  a broad range of substance disorders. We  have continued to build our pre-clinical data  package, including the recent presentation of  data at Neuroscience 2017 in Washington, DC. We have seen high levels of pre-clinical  partnering interest and have entered into  late stage commercial discussions. Forming strategic alliances Last year we announced we would no longer  continue providing any fee-for-service  capabilities choosing instead to seek  longer-term risk-sharing strategic alliances. In September 2016 we entered a  new multi-target, risk-sharing strategic  collaboration with Evotec AG (“Evotec”),  a leading drug discovery and development  alliance company. This deal enables us to  increase the output of our engine whilst  reducing risk and cost. Alongside our own proprietary suite of  cutting-edge technologies, the alliance with  Evotec will expand our ability to generate  commercially attractive pre-clinical assets  to meet the pharmaceutical industry’s  increasing demand for high quality, early  stage drug candidates. We will continue to seek similar,  value-adding alliances.  Successful fundraises In September 2016, we completed a  £5 million fundraise at 102 pence per  share bringing in several new investors,  including Calculus Capital Limited and  Polar Capital LLP . In March 2017 we completed a £7.0 million  fundraise at 85 pence per share bringing  in several new investors including Legal  & General and Hargreave Hale which have  strong track records in investing in the life  science sector. This new cash enables us  to progress and add to our pre-clinical  pipeline and provides working capital
