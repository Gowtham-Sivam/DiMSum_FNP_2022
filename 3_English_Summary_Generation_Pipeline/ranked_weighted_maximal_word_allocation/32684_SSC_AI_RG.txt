Stride Gaming has  grown its market share in its core UK bingo-led online gaming  market, continued to develop new growth opportunities  through product innovation, enhanced its proprietary technology  platform and appraised attractive new markets for future  expansion opportunities.

Strategic progress Stride’s progress during the year has continued to be  underpinned by the Group’s 10 Chief Executive’s report I am delighted to report that during 2017 Stride Gaming  continued to make excellent progress against its growth  strategy. The Group has continued to drive strong organic  growth and to scale the business through the successful  integration of the transformational acquisitions that were  made at the end of our previous financial year. Stride Gaming  is now the third largest operator in the UK online bingo-led  market* and we remain confident that this scale, supported  by our proprietary technology and back office expertise,  positions the business well to take advantage of further  growth opportunities.  Clear growth strategy  Stride Gaming has a clear growth strategy to develop as  a leading online gaming operator, thereby creating value for  shareholders. We aim to achieve this based on three primary  pillars of growth:  1. Focus on the core by continuing to grow market share  in both the UK bingo and casino markets. 2. Diversify the product offering by innovating the product  and entering new online gaming verticals. 3. Appraise and enter attractive new markets outside of  the UK. We plan to execute this growth strategy by continuing to  develop our proprietary gaming platform, investing in our  skilled and dynamic team and focusing on operating only  in regulated or legal markets.
