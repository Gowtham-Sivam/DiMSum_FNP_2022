Today, as we stand on the brink of our  second decade, we can look back on  our achievements with justifiable pride.  Despite a changing market environment  and pressures affecting the mining  industry as a whole, we are delivering  on our long-term commitments   and continuing to create value   through growth and returns for our  stakeholders. Over the last decade,   we have paid close to US$2.5 billion in  dividends, invested over US$4 billion to  sustain and expand our operations and  develop new projects, and increased  attributable silver and gold production  by over 55% and 245%, respectively. FOR MORE DETAILS ON OUR  ACHIEVEMENTS – IN BOTH FINANCIAL   AND NON-FINANCIAL TERMS – SINCE   THE IPO IN 2008  SEE PAGES 12, 26, 52, 72 While we remain confident about our  future and growth potential, we do   not ignore the challenges faced by the  mining industry. These include lower  grades, access to land, environmental  demands, social pressures and  growing complexities in the permitting  processes, among others. Managing  these pressures requires increased  focus and expertise to CHALLENGES. 07 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 07 FRESNILLO PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 FRESNILLO  TODAY STRATEGIC  REPORT CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FRESNILLO  TODAY STRATEGIC  REPORT CORPORATE  GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS Q&A WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE ONE PROJECT,   FOUR STRATEGIC PILLARS RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK SUSTAIN OPERATE DEVELOP EXPLORE FOR OUR BUSINESS MODEL SEE PAGES 18-19 QUICKLY IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR OPPORTUNITY   FOLLOWING THE IPO IN 2008, OUR SAN JULIÁN MINE IS   A FINE DEMONSTRATION OF OUR STRATEGY IN ACTION.
