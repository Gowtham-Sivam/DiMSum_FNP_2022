I am delighted that  the focus on our  strategic priorities  continues to deliver  positive results for  our stakeholders.” 8 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 8 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 HAMMERSON PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 8 More happened for shareholders WHAT HAVE BEEN THE HIGHLIGHTS   OF 2015? Our focus on generating sustainable income growth  continues to succeed, and we have grown EPS by 13%.  This enables us to once more increase the dividend for  our shareholders, which at 22.3p per share is up 9 .3%   on last year and with compound annual growth of 7 .7%  since 2011. NAV per share was up 11% principally due to a total  property return of 12.4%, significantly beating IPD . This strong financial performance is in part thanks to  the high quality of our portfolio. We continue to recycle  capital into those assets and developments which are  best positioned to create value for shareholders. A key  highlight of this year was our acquisition in Ireland  which provides a market-leading platform in Europe’s  fastest-growing economy. Acquiring a portfolio of loans  requires some extra steps before we own the properties  but, once the transaction is complete, we will operate  one of Europe’s leading shopping centres, Dundrum  Town Centre, Dublin. We also increased our investment  in the UK’s second city, Birmingham, through the  acquisition of Grand Central shopping centre in joint  venture with CPPIB. Birmingham offers an increasingly  wealthy catchment and improving public infrastructure  investment. To fund these transactions, we are on track  with a programme of disposals and we remain focused  on maintaining a prudent balance sheet. Like-for-like NRI growth of 2.3% is higher than last year  as we continue to see a growing demand for prime retail  and leisure space. Against a backdrop of falling vacancy,  combined with our Product Experience Framework  initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive future rental  income growth.  This year we successfully relocated our UK offices   to more cost-efficient sites, moving our London  headquarters to Kings Place, King’s Cross. Costs were  tightly controlled across the business and we reduced  total administrative costs, alongside investing further in  important areas such as digital and marketing. There is  still more to be done however, especially as a result of  additional property costs from the strategic  development properties we hold.  In 2015, we completed an impressive four developments,  adding 64,900m 2  of incremental retail space. This  included Le Jeu de Paume, a new regional shopping  centre in Beauvais; the Winter Garden restaurant and  leisure extension at Silverburn, Glasgow; a next- generation fashion park in Rugby with Elliott’ s Field; as  well as an M&S-anchored extension to Cyfarthfa Retail  Park, Merthyr Tydfil. We also made good progress at our  major London development schemes. HOW IS THE INVESTMENT PROPOSITION  FOR SHAREHOLDERS IN 2016  DIFFERENTIATED VERSUS PEERS? We are better positioned than ever to take advantage of  the improving consumer backdrop and to continue to  generate earnings growth ahead of our peers. As well as  owning prime real estate, driving rental growth requires  a thorough and hands-on approach to asset  management. This is where we are differentiated by our  embedded Product Experience Framework, which is  designed to deliver a consistently great experience for  shoppers and retailers across our portfolio. Furthermore, we remain the only European REIT with  strategic exposure to the premium outlets market. Our  investments in Value Retail and VIA Outlets materially  boosted our portfolio returns in 2015. We aim to further  grow our exposure to this market, which is set to benefit  from strong occupational demand driven by growing  global tourism. 2016 will see the opening of Victoria Gate, Leeds which,  together with Victoria Quarter, will create the leading  aspirational retail offer in the north of England. The  next 18 months will also see us make advancements on  our major London development schemes including  moving towards starting on-site at Brent Cross and  Croydon. These schemes are set to deliver retail assets  of the future and further differentiate our long-term  investment proposition. ‘11 16.6 17.7 19.1 20.4 22.3 ‘12 ‘13 ‘14 ‘15 Chart 1 Dividend per share (pence) 7.7% CAGR STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 9 HAMMERSON.COM STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION 9 STRATEGIC REPORT CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW In conversation with David Atkins, Chief Executive +140k downloads More happened for retailers WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TRENDS FOR  RETAILERS TAKING MORE SPACE?
