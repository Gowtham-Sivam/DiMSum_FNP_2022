Consequently, the   Board has recommended a 5% increase in the full year  dividend to 38.9p, in line with our progressive dividend  policy resulting in a 50% pay-out ratio based on adjusted  earnings per share. This reflects the Board’s confidence   in the future growth of the business. Our approach to capital allocation is based on a framework  which defines our priorities for uses of cash, underpinned  by our principle to maintain a strong balance sheet with  solid investment grade credit metrics. This underlines our  commitment to increasing shareholder returns over time,  which remains a key priority for the Board. Over the past five years, Burberry has returned around   £700m to shareholders through dividends, and in April 2017  completed £100m of a £150m announced share buyback.   A further share buyback of £300m will be completed   in FY 2018, in addition to the £50m already announced.   This is inclusive of the distribution of the Coty upfront sum.  Other Board developments The composition of the Board has evolved significantly   over the past few shareholders, for your support over the past 12 months. 11 Strategic Report – Introduction Christopher Bailey Chief Creative and Chief Executive Officer Alongside this more moderate growth outlook, we  anticipate the industry will be shaped by different   dynamics in the years ahead. Our customer is evolving  rapidly, prioritising more distinctive experiences, more  personal relationships with brands and greater product  innovation. The influence of digital technology is extending  still further across every aspect of what we do – from  production techniques to the customer experience, in every  channel. And demographic changes, from the maturing   of millennials to the intensification of wealth in cities,   mean we must keep developing and tailoring how we   think and work to stay ahead.  Against this backdrop, we continued last year to take  actions to elevate our luxury retail and digital business,  strengthen our brand and reposition Burberry for growth,  as we maintained our focus on maximising long-term  shareholder value. In addition to our ongoing actions in  wholesale and licensing, this included our announcement  last May of a multi-year programme to accelerate our  productivity and efficiency agenda, having identified  significant opportunities across our existing channels,  products and regions, and our ways of working. We  touched on these in our last report, and have since   distilled them into comprehensive plans covering five   key areas: Product Focus; Productive Space; E-commerce  Leadership; Operational Excellence and Inspired People,  the detail of which I will turn to shortly. 20 Strategic Report – Burberry Group Overview brand highlights Burberry’s ambition is to bring pioneering British creativity and culture to the world by creating beautifully made products,  inspiring with storytelling and shared experiences, delivering impeccable and distinctive services, and continually innovating.  This underpins how Burberry seeks to connect with its customers globally, from runway shows, campaign talent and music   to digital platforms, data and insight. The Burberry brand continues to resonate strongly with luxury consumers around the world, ending the year as one of the   best known luxury brands globally*. Key focus areas during the year Runway shows  In February 2016, Burberry announced plans to change   the way it creates, presents and sells its runway collections  with the launch of its first ‘see-now-buy-now’ runway   show. From September 2016, Burberry replaced its four- show calendar of two mens and two womens shows, with  two shows. The September and February shows featured  both womenswear and menswear collections. The new  show format and calendar were designed with a global  customer in mind. More than 300 stores had three runway  looks from the February 2017 collection, and the entire  runway collection was available to purchase in 80 stores  globally immediately following the runway show. Both the  September and February collections were also available to  purchase online as the products were shown on the runway.  This industry leading change removed the traditional gap  between the runway show and retail availability. For the week following the September
