Whilst the Annual Report continues to be a core part of our reporting suite, we use a simplified format and include links to interactive online content, such as videos. This online material brings to life what we do and how we do it, and provides you with a better overall understanding of our business. We also provide summaries at the start of each key section (denoted by an S in the contents to the left). We continue to publish a separate report that summarises our progress towards meeting the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‘TCFD’), as well as a comprehensive addendum that includes data on Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) topics. ESG reporting We have also reported against a number of voluntary reporting frameworks to help our stakeholders understand our sustainable business performance. Disclosures prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (‘GRI’) or Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (‘SASB’) guidance can be found in our ESG Addendum or on investors.vodafone.com. vodafone.com investors.vodafone.com investors.vodafone.com/tcfd investors.vodafone.com/ esgaddendum investors.vodafone.com/sasb investors.vodafone.com/ESG References The Annual Report has been designed to aid navigation.
