HOW WE DO IT
We have three strategic priorities, shown below, which guide our operating model,  
capital deployment and financial management and which we believe drive sustained

We actively manage our properties to generate sustainable income growth. We recognise the importance of strong retailer 
relationships and the requirement for tenant rotation to enhance the vibrancy of the consumer experience.

We maintain a strong balance sheet with our prime property portfolio underpinned by a robust capital base of bank borrowing, 
bond debt and shareholder equity. Our financing structure provides us with the capacity and flexibility to deliver our business 
objectives and take advantage of opportunistic investments to further enhance the Group’s performance.
