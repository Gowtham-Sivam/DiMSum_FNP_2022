 Economic report 2017.  10 Empresaria Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2017 Chairman’s statement The Group has delivered  another record year of profit.  Our business model and  strategy is delivering  consistently, with 18 quarters  of year-on-year net fee  income growth for the period  to December 2017 .  As well as the growth in profit, our  diversification across sectors and geographies  helps to reduce risk and insulate the Group  from difficulties in individual markets. Empresaria is a global business, operating  from locations in 20 countries. Whilst global  reach is clearly important, local focus is key  with our management teams running their  businesses in alignment with local market  conditions and opportunities. As part of our strategy to develop leading  brands, we invest to help them develop and  take a leading position within their niche  sector area of expertise. It is important that  each brand has the potential to develop  within the Group and where changes are  needed, we identify and implement them.  In line with this ethos, we ended 2017 with  18 brands, having merged two brands and  exited from another. The Board sees good  opportunities for growth across the Group  and we will continue to invest in our brands  to build capacity and coverage. The market As we enter 2018 the worldwide economic  conditions are largely positive, with  synchronised growth forecast for the  first time since the global financial crisis.  The main markets that we operate in are  expected to grow, and this includes the  UK where we continue to operate under  a cloud of Brexit uncertainty. We are seeing  candidate shortages across our markets  and regions. We play a vital role in helping  client companies find the right resources  they need to grow.

These shares are held in an  Employee Benefit Trust to cover potential  exercises of vested share options thus  reducing the dilutive effect of issuing new  shares. Based on the number of vested  options and the share price at the time, this  was a sensible use of capital for the benefit  of all shareholders.  Outlook The Group has a strong platform from  which to deliver the next phase of growth.  The economic conditions are positive and  whilst we maintain a cautious view on  political risk, we see good opportunities  to develop our Group further during the  year ahead. We have a proven strategy  and brands that have the potential to grow  their profit.

How we meet  our objectives We follow an Invest and Develop  approach to deliver on our strategy.  We are a strategic investor, looking to  invest in like-minded people who share  our values and are passionate about  their business. It is important for our existing  brands to develop and grow their  profits over the long-term. Organic  investment helps them to develop  their services and grow scale and  coverage. This is done by the  following:  • Increase the headcount in an  existing brand  • Add a new vertical specialism to  an existing brand  • Enter a new or existing geography  with an existing brand  • Start up in a niche sector DEVELOP To accelerate our growth we also  look at external investments, to fill  gaps in our sector or geographic  coverage or to bring in specific  market knowledge into the Group. External investment will occur where  we don’t currently have a presence in  a region or sector or to help develop  an existing brand by filling in gaps in  their service offering:  • Enter a new geography or sector  with a new brand  • Grow an existing brand with   a bolt-on acquisition It is important to have the right culture  fit with any external investment,  typically finding businesses that  have potential but have reached  a point where they need help to move  forward to the next level. We want to  work with them to develop a leading  staffing brand. INVEST Our investment activity is dependent  on the resources we have available.  We are in an overall debt position  and we target a ‘debt to debtors’  ratio of 25%.  Our preference is for investments  to be
