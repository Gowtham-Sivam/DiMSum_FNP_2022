Introduction 2017 has been a pivotal year for  our business in which we fully  aligned our operations to focus  on cybersecurity software.  Our management team has worked  tirelessly to deliver on our stated  growth objectives which has now  culminated in the renaming and  rebranding of the business to Kape  Technologies plc (previously  Crossrider plc), an important  milestone in the repositioning of the  business. Since October 2016, the  Company has focused on both  acquiring and developing  cybersecurity software solutions for  consumers, whilst utilising its  proprietary digital distribution  technology to grow its user base  across the Company’s product suite.  The Company’s management has  deployed Kape’s in-depth expertise  and technological capabilities within  its digital marketing platform to  support and grow our expanded  customer base and promote our own  products and services. This market  leading digital pedigree has enabled  the Group to accelerate the Company’s  successful transformation during 2017.  Products  In the last year, management has  taken great strides to broaden our  product stack, which includes our  Reimage software and DriverAgent  solutions. In March 2017, we acquired  CyberGhost, a cybersecurity SaaS  provider with specific focus on the  provision of virtual private network  (“VPN”) solutions, as well as a sizeable  customer base. With CyberGhost now  fully integrated into the Group, I am  pleased to report it has performed  ahead of management’s expectations  both on a revenue and profit level. In addition, and as part of the  expansion into new products, the  Company has launched Reimage for  Mac, expanding the product’s  potential customer base.  We continue to experience positive  customer traction across all our  products, further demonstrating our  ability to successfully leverage our  expertise and digital marketing platform  in order to drive higher margins. 3 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CORPORATE   GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS STRATEGIC   REPORT Strategic priorities  Our management team remains  committed to delivering sustainable  growth and is therefore focused on  the following key strategic priorities:  • to develop the Company’s product  offering organically through internal  R&D and to grow our user base across  the Company’s growing portfolio of  software products, leveraging Kape’s  proprietary distribution technology  and expertise;  • to continue to implement our plan  for new acquisitions that subscriptions 4 KAPE TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS CHIEF EXECUTIVE   OFFICER’S REVIEW IDO ERLICHMAN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Over the past 12 months we have  delivered on our growth strategy.  The group has made significant  headway in developing our  product suite, which has been  greatly enhanced. Introduction When I joined Kape (formerly  Crossrider plc) in May 2016, I did so  with a clear vision of where I, with the  full support of the Board, wanted to  take this business. It was clear that  despite our pedigree in digital marketing,  our future laid beyond adtech.  I am therefore delighted to look back at  2017 as a year of significant strategic  and operational progress. Over the  past 12 months we have delivered on a  number of key milestones and taken  notable steps to becoming one of the  leading next generation providers of  consumer cybersecurity products. We have built on our existing PC repair  (Reimage) and device driver update  (DriverAgent) solutions, through both the  acquisition and internal development of  new products during the year, which is a  clear sign of our ambition. Central to our strategy has been to  shift our product focus to be B2C-driven  and SaaS enabled thereby increasing  our recurring revenue base, creating a  more predictable sales platform from  which to grow.  We are therefore delighted to have  delivered such a strong underlying  EBITDA performance, up 172%, excluding  the Web Apps and License segment,  further demonstrating the excellent  performance of our business model. Operational update  In March 2017, we acquired  CyberGhost, a leading cybersecurity  SaaS provider with a focus on the  provision of virtual private network  (“VPN”) solutions. The acquisition was  successfully integrated into Kape by  June 2017 and I am delighted to  report, made a positive net profit  contribution in the year of $1.5 million. With CyberGhost now consolidated into  the larger Kape operation, we have been  successful in generating significant  synergies and delivering superior  customer traction post-integration with  our digital user acquisition platform. This  resulted in an increase in CyberGhost’s  user base by over 30% compared to  December 2016 and the last quarter of  2017 saw record sales for the business  in terms of volume and EBITDA.  We have grown Kape’s product  portfolio this year and it now consists  of four main products: the CyberGhost  VPN, a SaaS product, as well as the  Reimage PC, DriverAgent and Reimage  for Mac, which are purchased on a  one-time and yearly unlimited
