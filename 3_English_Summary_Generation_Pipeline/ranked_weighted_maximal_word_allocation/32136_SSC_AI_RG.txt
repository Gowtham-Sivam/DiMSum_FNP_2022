We also have a growing international online  business. Following a strategic review of  our International business, we are focusing  on our established joint venture and  franchise partnerships and operating fewer  wholly-owned markets. In January 2007, we launched Plan A to  address the key environmental, social and  ethical challenges facing M&S. After ten years  +1 0.7% 04 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW This is my last Annual Report as Chairman  after more than six years at M&S. It has  been an extraordinary honour to serve  this company.  Since Steve Rowe became Chief Executive,  he has set out clear plans to accelerate the  pace of change across M&S. By simplifying  the way we do things and by focusing on the  customer, we have laid solid foundations  for growth. We repositioned our Clothing &  Home business, made important decisions  about the future shape of our UK and  International store estates, and put in place  fairer pay and beneﬁ ts for our employees.  It has been a year of great change outside  M&S as well. Last summer’s vote to leave  the European Union has caused inevitable  uncertainty. Nobody yet knows what the  long-term eff ect of Brexit will be. Like many  businesses we have been impacted by the  depreciation of sterling, but it is our job to  seize the opportunities ahead and prepare  for all eventualities.  We have made some hard decisions. Some  have led to signiﬁ cant adjustments to our  proﬁ ts this year and also, in the case of  repositioning our Clothing & Home business,  to some short-term reduction in our  adjusted proﬁ ts. However, these changes  needed to be made for the long-term  health of the business. Decisive action and  strong execution have never been more  important to compete in a fast-changing  retail environment. These actions allow us  to embrace the future from a position of  strength, well equipped for a digital age  and with a sustainable business model.  PERFORMANCE I believe our food is, without exaggeration,  among the best in the world. Once again,  we delivered a good performance in a  tough market. Sales grew as customers  responded to the quality of OF CUSTOMERS UNDER 35 08 MARKS AND SPENCER GROUP PLC STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW A year ago, I started in my role as Chief  Executive by posing a series of questions  that I hoped would help unlock the future of  M&S, giving us a platform from which to ﬁ rst  recover and then to grow. 201 6/1 7 has been  a year of change as we started to answer  these questions, which I address below.  The steps we are taking are making a  diff erence and we are making progress.  However, as we said when we set out our  plan, it has resulted in some short-term  pain. Some of the action needed has been  costly and proﬁ ts are down. Clothing &  Home sales were down year-on-year as we  reduced promotions and markdown activity.  We expected this and we still believe we are  doing the right thing for the future of our  business. We have seen encouraging signs  from the increase in full-price Clothing &  Home sales and in the sales growth during  the key Christmas trading period. And in  Food, we continued to grow ahead of the  market with new stores outperforming  expectations.  The business has adapted well as we start to  build a sustainable foundation for the future.  We have laid a lot of the groundwork for  our recovery; however, we are not there yet.  I want to see consistent delivery over time  and I want to see us move out of recovery.  Even as our performance improves, we  can’t stand still. While we are still focused  on recovering our business and we have a  lot more to do, I am also starting to look  to future growth opportunities, some of  which I outline at the end of this update.
