Our  PeoplePlus division has met the challenge of  delivering the final years of the existing Work  Programme, continuing to be the best  performing supplier to the DWP and  positioning itself to become a leading  supplier of Apprenticeship Levy training.  Other opportunities during 2017 included  winning the Fair Start programme in  Scotland.  Performance 2017 was the final year of our five-year  plan to “Burst the Billion”, aiming to  grow Group revenues to over £1bn by  2017. Group revenues of £957.8m (2016:  £882.4m), up 9%, leaves us just short  of this target. However, the exiting run  rate of 2017 exceeds this target and  remains a significant achievement  compared to the starting point of  revenues of £367m in 2012, when the  five-year plan began. The five-year  underlying operating profit target of  £30m was comfortably exceeded, being  achieved two years early, in 2015. Underlying profit before tax* reduced  by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). Whilst  a reduction, this is a good achievement  given the Work Programme run-off  in PeoplePlus that began in March  2017. Reported profit before tax  increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016:  • To get the job done 10 Staffline Group plc Annual Report 2017 Chief Executive   Officer’s statement Trading Sales in 2017 grew by 9% to £957.8m  (2016: £882.4m). A change in the sales   mix between the two divisions, with  Recruitment accounting for 88% of  the 2017 revenue (2016: 84%), has had  a comparative impact on the Group’s  gross profit margin, with a reduction  from 14.2% in 2016 to 11.9% in 2017 .  Underlying profit before tax* reduced  by 1% to £36.3m (2016: £36.7m). On  this basis, adjusted diluted earnings  per share fell to 112.6p (2016: 114.0p), a  reduction of 1%. However, reported profit  before tax from continuing operations  increased by 28% to £24.1m (2016:  £18.9m) and reported diluted earnings  per share from continuing operations  rose by 21% to 71.1p (2016: 58.8p). *  Underlying profit before tax excludes  amortisation charges from intangible assets  arising on business combinations, acquisition  and exceptional re-organisation costs, and the  non-cash charge/credit for share based  payment costs (“SBPC”) Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”) The Group monitors a number of  performance indicators both financial   and non-financial.
