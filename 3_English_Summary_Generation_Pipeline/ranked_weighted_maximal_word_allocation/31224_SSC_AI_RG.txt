Operating a GAN PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 7 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT A culture of innovation Dear shareholders During the course of 2017 the Group expanded  its market share in the US, our key geographic  market, by launching additional US land-based  casinos as clients of either virtual currency- based Simulated Gaming TM  or traditional real  money regulated gaming conducted on an  intra-State basis. In April 2017 the Group  announced that it had successfully issued its  first convertible loan note as a public company,  raising gross proceeds of £2.0m in loan capital  to continue expansion of real money regulated  gaming and Simulated Gaming™ opportunities  in the US, and for working capital and general  business development purposes. As has been widely reported, regulated   real money Internet gaming in New Jersey   has been growing strongly. Our Group has  executed well in delivering operationally   for Paddy Power Betfair plc in New Jersey,  earning a well-deserved reputation in the   US for technical competence, reflecting   the reputation already hard earned in   Europe’s toughest regulated Internet gaming  markets. This reputation has translated   into additional business secured in   February 2017 for GAN in New Jersey   with a major land-based New Jersey   operator Ocean Resort Casino (formerly   known as ‘Revel Casino’) nominating GAN as   the future platform for regulated real money  Internet gaming commencing in 2018.

Substantial continued investment has been  made in the US operational structure to  develop the Group’s US presence in both the   real money regulated gaming and Simulated  Gaming™ markets. In the UK and Bulgaria  further substantial investment has been   made in the Group’s software technology   and its capability to deliver both Simulated  Gaming™ and real money regulated gaming   to US casino operators, integrated with the   US casino operators’ existing land-based  loyalty programme. Intra-State regulation of real money Internet  gaming re-started with Pennsylvania passing  legislation in October 2017 to permit Internet  gaming, nearly four years after New Jersey’s  Internet gaming market commenced.  Legislative actions also occurred in several  other US States in 2017, which suggests the  State-by-State regulation of Internet gaming  may progress further in the US during
