Overview Private Equity Infrastructure Audited ﬁnancial   statements Corporate   Governance Portfolio and  other information Financial review, Risk and  Corporate responsibility 03 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 The Group delivered another robust  performance in FY2017 . The sale of Debt  Management, completed in March 2017 ,  has simpliﬁed and focused the Group  on its two principal businesses, both  of which performed well. Private Equity  delivered very strong returns, driven  by signiﬁcant portfolio earnings growth.  Infrastructure continues to execute its  updated strategy effectively, generating  good returns with a strong pipeline of  new business. Market environment FY2017 was dominated by unexpected  political events, including the UK’s decision  to leave the EU and the result of the US  presidential election. These events created  volatile conditions, but with supportive  debt markets and high volumes of  capital still seeking attractive investment  opportunities in both Private Equity  and Infrastructure, the market environment   remains intensely competitive. Under these  conditions, our permanent capital base,  strong balance sheet and long-established  business networks in our target sectors  and geographies represent a distinct  competitive advantage. They enable the  Group to be agile and opportunistic while  remaining focused on investment discipline  and effective asset management. Performance and dividend The Group’s total return increased by  93% to £1,592 million (2016: £824 million).  Net asset value increased to 604 pence  per share (31 March 2016: 463 pence) and  our return on opening shareholders’ funds  was 36% (2016: 22%). A strong market  for realisations meant that we were, as  anticipated, net divestors during FY2017 .  We repaid our €331 million bond in March  2017 and ended the year with a net cash  balance of £419 million and liquidity of  £1,323 million (31 March 2016: net cash of  £165 million and liquidity of £1,352 million). In recognition of the strong level of cash  realisations (including the proceeds  from the sale of our Debt Management  business) and taking into account the  strength of the investment pipeline, the  Board has recommended a ﬁnal dividend  of 18.5 pence per share (2016: 16 pence  per share) for FY2017 . This is made up  of 3i Group Annual report and accounts 2017 04 Chief Executive’s   review We continued to make very strong  progress at 3i in FY2017 . Our ﬁnancial  results were excellent and underpinned  by strong fundamentals.  Our Private Equity investment portfolio  has undergone a major transformation  over the last ﬁve years as we have sold  many of the weaker, legacy assets and  made new investments in good quality  companies at attractive prices. Our Infrastructure team has also been  busy and assembled a sizeable economic  infrastructure portfolio for 3i Infrastructure  plc (“3iN”), as well as pursuing a number  of new initiatives to broaden our  investment capability. We sold our Debt Management business  for £270 million during the year, as we were  not conﬁdent that this business would  meet our return requirements and justify  its relative complexity in a more onerous  regulatory environment in the future. A measure of the success of these changes  can be seen in this year’s ﬁnancial results;   3i generated a total return on shareholders’  funds of £1,592 million, or 36% (2016: £824  million, or 22%), ending the year with a  NAV per share of 604 pence (31 March  2016: 463 pence). Our results include the  beneﬁt of currency movements; 71% of  the Group’s assets are denominated in  euros or US dollars and we generated a  £297 million gain (2016: £143 million gain)  from the weakness of sterling in the year.  Cash realisations, including the proceeds  from the sale of Debt Management, were  strong at £1,308 million and we saw a good  step forward in cash investment to £638  million. We ﬁnished the year with net cash  of £419 million (31 March 2016: £165 million)  and have announced a further good lift in  the pay out to shareholders. A high quality Private Equity  investment portfolio Our plan with new Private Equity  investments is simple, but the execution  is not and requires diligence, discipline  and good judgement. We aim to double  the earnings of new investments under  our ownership through operational  improvements,
