OUR VALUES CHAIRMAN’S ST A TEMENT AVEVA DELIVERED A RESILIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET GROWTH, STRENGTHENING  CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, WINNING NEW CUSTOMERS AND  DEVELOPING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO. I am pleased to report that AVEVA  delivered a resilient performance  during 2016/17 , despite two of our key  end markets, Oil & Gas and Marine,  remaining subdued. Revenue increased  7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016 – £201.5  million) assisted by currency translation  and profit before tax was £46.9 million  (2016 – £29.4 million), supported by  strong cost discipline. On an adjusted  basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to  £55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million).  The Group also increased cash from  operating activities by 58.2% to   £57 .2 million (2016 – £36.1 million).  We are maintaining our progressive  dividend policy and propose to  increase the total dividend for the  year to 40.0 pence per share (2016  – 36.0 pence). This represents an  increase of 11.1% over the prior year,  underpinned by our confidence in the  long-term prospects for the business. AVEVA’s net cash position at the year  end grew to £130.9 million   (2016 – £107 .9 million). The Board  believes that it is important to maintain  a strong balance sheet. This gives our  customers confidence in the strength  of our business and allows us to have   at hand sufficient resources to   invest in AVEVA’s future growth, for  example, by investing in Research &  Development and capitalising on  acquisition opportunities as they  become available. Delivering on our strategy In addition to delivering solid  results, we have remained focused  on executing upon our strategy, in  order to position AVEVA to achieve  growth well into the future. AVEVA achieved good momentum in  sales of products beyond the core 3D  design software that currently makes  up the majority of our revenue. We  also made good progress with our  strategy of increasing our sales to  Owner Operators (OOs), growth in  CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STRA TEGIC REVIEW WHILST CONDITIONS REMAIN CHALLENGING IN  OUR CORE OIL & GAS AND MARINE MARKETS,   OUR BUSINESS HAS SEEN EXCELLENT SUCCESSES   IN OUR KEY GROWTH INDUSTRIES. As expected, AVEVA’s financial  performance was resilient despite the  challenging conditions in our core end  markets. In addition to delivering solid  results, we made good progress in  delivering against our strategy during  the year and in structuring the business  to enable future growth. Revenue  increased 7 .1% to £215.8 million (2016  – £201.5 million), assisted by a currency  translation benefit of 11.4%. Profit  before tax grew to £46.9 million (2016  – £29.4 million), supported by a strong  focus on cost control. On an adjusted  basis, profit before tax grew 7 .4% to  £55.0 million (2016 – £51.2 million). On a regional basis, revenue in the  Americas grew due to a strong  performance in North America, partly  offset by difficult market conditions  in Latin America, specifically in Brazil.  AVEVA’s performance in EMEA and Asia  Pacific was robust in the context of the  subdued Oil & Gas and Marine markets.  Overall Group revenue declined in  constant currency terms by 3.8%,  although we did see an improvement  in the second half. Excluding Latin  America, Group revenue declined only  2.3% in constant currency terms for the  full year, and was flat in the second half. We made good progress in executing  our strategy. On a constant currency  basis, we delivered good growth with  More Than 3D (MT3D), Owner  Operators and sales to the Power  sector. The strength of our product offering  was demonstrated by several key  new business wins during the year.  These included wins in both markets  that offer growth opportunities  for us and in our more mature  product and geographic areas. During the year, I took over as CEO and  David Ward transitioned to the post of  CFO. We have both been in the  business for
