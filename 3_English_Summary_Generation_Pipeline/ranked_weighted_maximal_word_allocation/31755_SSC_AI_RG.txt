Since the year end we have completed  the acquisition of Acetum S.p.A.,   a producer of high-quality balsamic  vinegar from Modena, Italy. We look  forward to the opportunity of developing  further this fine business, using   our existing capability in selling and  marketing speciality foods internationally.  Primark has the potential for significant  growth and this was demonstrated   again this year by its opening of a   net 30 stores and 1.5 million sq ft of   selling space across nine countries.   The Primark management team   also had further success in mitigating  currency headwinds, they delivered   on-trend fashion and their stores have  never looked better. We look forward   to further growth in the coming year. Two business disposals took place   at the beginning of the financial year.   In November 2016 the sale of our US  herbs and spices operation significantly  reduced the complexity of ACH and  facilitated a reduction in overhead.   In December 2016 we sold our cane  sugar operations in south China to a  party better placed to drive its further  development. We are proud of the  transformation in agricultural productivity,  sugar yields and factory efficiencies   that we achieved over our 20 years of  ownership. We realised a pre-tax profit   of £293m from these two disposals   with little impact on the group’s   trading profit. Corporate responsibility Our group has grown and evolved  considerably since its formation in   1935 and a great deal has changed,   but the essence of what we do has  remained a constant. 06 2017 HAS BEEN A BUSY YEAR   FOR OUR BUSINESSES GROCERY REFRESHING OUR BRANDS 19 SUGAR THE SCIENCE OF   SEED PROTECTION 27 AGRICULTURE EVOLUTION THROUGH   INNOVATION 33 INGREDIENTS EMBRACING TECHNOLOGY 39 RETAIL IT’S ALL ABOUT   THE EXPERIENCE 46 and merchandising teams and margin  declined by less than expected at   the beginning of the year to 10.4%.  Notwithstanding this highly successful  year, Primark constantly seeks better  ways of delivering value to customers,  be that through store design and  location, stock availability, or enhancing  its reputation for on-trend fashion.   The Primark website and social media  are playing an ever more important role  in the relationship with our customers   in driving awareness of our products   and footfall in our stores. Primark will  continue to expand its selling space  across all its countries of operation with  another strong programme of new store  openings scheduled for the coming year. Implications of the EU referendum The consequences for the group of the  UK’s decision to leave the EU should   be seen in the context of the diversity   of our operations and geographical  footprint, combined with a business  model that has discrete Primark supply  chains for the UK and Eurozone and,  wherever possible, aligns food production  with the end markets for our products.  Changes in legislation and trade  agreements provide significant  opportunities for the food industry to  replace imported food and build export  markets and, for UK agricultural policy  particularly, they have the potential   to benefit our group. We are engaged   at all levels with a number of UK  Government departments to ensure   that the full range of opportunities and  risks, as they affect us, are recognised. We are pleased with the Government’s  commitment that least developed  countries will not face an increase in  tariffs on their exports
