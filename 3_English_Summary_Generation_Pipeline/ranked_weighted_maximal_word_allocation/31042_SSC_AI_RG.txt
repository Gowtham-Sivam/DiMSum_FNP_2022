The remaining spend largely  relates to the settlement of deferred  invoices in respect of the Alma/Galia  and Scolty/Crathes developments and  the Eagle discovery.

Amjad Bseisu Chief Executive EnQuest’s priorities and performance  in 2017 2017 was a transformational year for  EnQuest, positioning the Group for  profitable growth and transitioning from  a period of heavy capital investment to  one in which the Group can begin to  reduce its debt. The Group focused on  the Kraken development, completion of  the asset acquisitions from BP, delivery  against our financial and operational  targets and the effective management  of the Group’s financial position. Operational performance EnQuest was proud to deliver first  oil from Kraken on schedule while  significantly reducing full cycle gross  capital expenditure. Kraken is one of the  largest developments in the North Sea in  the last ten years, comprising a phased  drilling campaign of 25 wells tied back  to a complex new Floating Production,  Storage and Offloading (‘FPSO’) vessel.  The drilling performance has been  excellent, with the first three programmes  completed early and at a lower cost than  originally planned. The FPSO has taken  longer than expected to commission,  leading to lower operational efficiency  than planned.

On 1 December 2017, EnQuest completed  the acquisition of initial interests in  Magnus, SVT and associated infrastructure  from BP and assumed operatorship.  This large and complex transition  was achieved safely and efficiently,  delivered on time and on budget, with  the integration of these assets into the
