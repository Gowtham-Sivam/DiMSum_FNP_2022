Dixons Carphone plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 Strategic report Business segments  4  I am pleased to be reporting on a very encouraging first year  since the merger of Carphone Warehouse and Dixons Retail.  We have had a strong start, with pro forma Headline profit  before tax rising 21% to £381 million. Progress has been good  across the board and in virtually all territories, with excellent  market share gains in all core countries in all key categories,  and record customer satisfaction numbers. Some important  strategic goals have also been achieved, most notably the  disposals of non-core operations in France, Germany, the  Netherlands and Portugal. In addition, it is good to see real  traction with some key new clients in our Connected World  Services business including our agreement with Sprint. In  short, it has been a good year and the Board is pleased to  recommend a final dividend of 6.0p per share to be paid on   25 September 2015.  At the same time, the team have made really good progress in  bringing our two great companies together. Much has been  achieved on this vital journey and, in particular, It gives me  enormous pleasure to see so many fully-functioning Carphone  Warehouse stores doing so well inside CurrysPCWorld stores  up and down the country. I believe that the team are doing  something that is both hard to do and relatively rare: creating   a genuine merger of equals where the best parts of each  company are preserved.  While this is very encouraging so far, I am also aware that  getting this right is not optional. We brought the businesses  together because we believed that increasingly interconnected  customers were going to require something new from us: a  powerful partner to help them navigate these new technologies.  Over the last year we have started to think about our customer  needs very hard and how we will address them going forward  – not only through the products that we offer, but also through  the services 5  I am very proud to be reporting on the first year of the newly  merged Dixons Carphone Group. In eleven months we have  established the new organisational structures of the Group,   UK & Ireland, and Sweden, rolled out almost 250 Carphone  Warehouse SWAS, exited retail operations in Germany and the  Netherlands, signed material contracts in Connected World  Services, and launched a new MVNO in the UK under the iD  brand. More importantly, during this time we have also  delivered very strong trading, taken market share in all  territories and delivered record customer satisfaction right  across the business.  The business has also had a strong first year financially. We  have delivered PBT ahead of guidance, increasing pro forma  Headline PBT from £316 million to £381 million, resulting in   an increase in pro forma Headline basic EPS from 20.5p to  25.5p. Pro forma net debt is also lower than expectation at  £260 million.  In the UK & Ireland, like-for-like sales were up 8% (13% in Q4)  and EBIT grew by 26% to £306 million, reflecting strong  performances in both electricals and mobile. In electricals,  white goods and TVs sold particularly well with customers  responding to our range, pricing and - above all - service  initiatives. Our mobile business in the UK & Ireland also saw  very encouraging sales growth. Postpay volumes and market  share continued to grow year-on-year in relatively quiet  markets as the business benefited from the exit of Phones 4u  and successful product launches. We are also - cautiously -  encouraged by the impact on ARPU from higher levels of   data usage.   Also in the UK, we launched our new MVNO, iD, in May.  Enabled by an innovative IT platform, it will target a number   of specific customer segments, with a particular focus on  personalising plans with flexible tariffs and introducing shared  data tariffs,
