As reported at the half year, at the beginning of 2017 we reviewed our business  structure and consolidated our Business Units from four to two. Our Branded Business  Unit focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of all the Group’s branded  products. Our OEM business focuses on the distribution, marketing and innovation of  all the Group’s products that are supplied to our medical device partners and marketed  under their brands. This new structure is designed to enhance focus and improve  marketing efficiencies for the Group. We have restated our segmental prior year  financials in line with this new reporting structure. Good progress has been made with all of our brands.
