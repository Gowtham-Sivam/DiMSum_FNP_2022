Charles Stanley Annual report and accounts 2017 02 Chairman’s statement Financial results The Group’s reported revenue for the year ended  31 March 2017 was £141.6 million, in line with that reported  in the previous year. The reported profit before tax improved  to £8.8 million, compared with a loss of £0.3 million in the  previous year and a loss of £6.1 million in the year before  that. The positive direction of travel is clear, as is the success  of our programme of cost control.  Funds under Management and Administration stood at  £24.0 billion at the year-end, compared with £20.5 billion   the year before, an increase of 17.1%. This mirrors the  improvement in the market index that we track, though  the increase in Discretionary funds was significantly ahead  of this over the 12-month period, up from £9.4 billion to  £11.4 billion, or 21.3%.  Our cash position remains strong, at £58.4 million compared  with £48.4 million at the previous year-end (both years are  inclusive of cash balances held within assets held for sale).  Remuneration structures It is pleasing to report that by the year-end we had  substantially completed our major project of restructuring  the remuneration arrangements of our investment managers.

As a consequence we have greater alignment
