For example, through a joint bid with Transport for   West Midlands, our bus business has recently secured Department  for Transport investment for new bus lanes on the important Harborne   to Birmingham city centre route. We have introduced our state-of-the- art Platinum buses to this route, with the aspiration of repeating the  significant increases in passengers we have seen where previous  schemes (such as Lode Lane in Solihull) have combined journey   time savings with new, premium vehicles. It is precisely this strong  partnership approach that we are looking to further enhance by  working closely together to make sure the 2022 Commonwealth  Games in Birmingham are a success and deliver significant   transport improvements before the games begin.

Beyond this, our task is to focus on the improved outcomes that   can be delivered through the right technologies, rather than chasing  every innovation that appears on the market. I believe new technology  presents a real opportunity to drive organic growth, improve standards  and realise
