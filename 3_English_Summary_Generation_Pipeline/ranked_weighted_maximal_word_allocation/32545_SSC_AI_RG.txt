Let me open this report on FY2017 by  reverting to my statement for the  previous year.  In May 2016, we were looking at two  central themes. First, that Vedanta’s  low-cost production ethos and focus on  cash flows positioned us to be highly  resilient in the face of any prolonged  downturn in the commodity market. In  addition, Vedanta was well positioned  to benefit from any upturn, and that  we were cautiously optimistic that an  improvement might come soon. Back to  today, and I’m pleased to report that the  market did indeed see a marked upturn,  and that we made sure we maximised  the opportunities that came with that  recovery. In FY2017 , Vedanta delivered a  strong performance across each of the  key financial metrics and this has given  us a good springboard into FY2018.  THE MARKET: RETURNING TO BALANCE  We saw an altogether better  environment for our business in FY2017 .  The commodities sector benefited  from a combination of positive global  economic activity, coupled with a  progressive tightening of commodity  supply. This resulted in the World Bank  Commodities Prices
