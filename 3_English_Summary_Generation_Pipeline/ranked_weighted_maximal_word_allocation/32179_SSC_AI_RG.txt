Looking at the figures from continuing  operations, adjusted pre-tax profits increased by 9.1% to £53.3m (2016: £48.8m), and  statutory pre-tax profits reached £40.9m (2016: £35.1m), on revenue down by 0.6% to  £740.3m (2016: £744.7m); adjusted earnings per share for the year rose by 7.2% to 53.3p  (2016: 49.7p), and statutory EPS increased to 38.0p (2016: 32.8p). This performance was achieved in the face of challenging market conditions, with the  strong headwinds we have seen over the last few years persisting during the first half of the  year. And while the record gap between standard variable energy tariffs and aggressively  priced introductory deals started to narrow during the autumn, this happened too late to  provide any positive impact on our service and customer numbers for Q3.  As previously reported, we responded to this more favourable environment by making  a change to our Partner compensation plan at the beginning of Q4; this gave Partners  the opportunity to accelerate some of the residual income they would earn on new  Members who switched all their utilities to us.  This enhancement, combined with our more competitive market position, led to an  increase in Partner activity as we progressed through Q4, taking full year customer and  service numbers to 607,802 (2016: 598,613) and 2,288,918 (2016: 2,181,704) respectively  – an increase of more than 107,000 services during the year. Within this total, there has  once again been a significant improvement in customer quality, with 102,126 (2016:  76,764) residential Members now taking all our core services (landline, broadband,  mobile, gas and electricity). We received a number of further endorsements from Which? during the year,  recognising both the value we offer and the quality of service provided by our UK-based  membership support teams. In addition to being ranked amongst the top suppliers  for all our core services (Energy, Broadband/Telephony and Mobile) in each of their  sector surveys, we received Recommended Provider awards for both our Broadband  and Mobile services. Further to this, we were delighted to receive the accolade of Best  Telecom Services Provider at the recent Which? 2017 Annual Awards ceremony. In  addition, we received four awards from Moneywise, and were voted UK National Public  Champion (and named as a finalist in the Business of the Year category for companies  with a turnover of €150m or higher) in the European Business Awards. These third party  independent endorsements are a testament to our customer-centric approach, our  commitment to treating our members fairly, our ongoing mission to be the Nation’s  most trusted utility provider, and the significant resources invested in delivering the best  possible customer service. ‘‘ ” Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements   Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2017 5 RESULTS OVERVIEW Our adjusted profit from continuing operations (i.e. excluding the contribution from Opus) reflects the  continuing modest organic growth over the last two years in the number of services we are providing to  our Members, an increased proportion of revenues from higher margin telephony services, and a one-off  recovery of costs incurred in prior years relating to the smart meter roll-out programme under our energy  supply agreement, counterbalanced by recurring customer acquisition costs which were higher this year  (primarily due to Daffodil), continued investment in headcount and increased spending on IT. We also  generated an exceptional profit of £62.3m during the year from the sale of our 20% shareholding in  Opus (see below), taking our total post-tax profit to £95.0m (2016: £31.8m). Revenues fell slightly due to lower average 12 June 2017 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW Telecom Plus PLC Report and Accounts 2015 12
