Whilst this  was unsettling for many of our staff, it was an  exercise that had to be undertaken to ensure  the business has a solid functional backbone  from which to support our growth in the future. There were also a number of changes to our  Executive Management team during the year.  Leo Mondale, President of our Aviation Business  Unit, and Michele Franci, our Chief Technology  Officer, both left the business in 2017. I would  like to thank both Leo and Michele for their  significant contributions to the business over  the years and I wish them all the very best  for the future. Phil Balaam, previously our Chief Strategy  Officer, replaced Leo as the President of our  Aviation Business Unit, running our global  Aviation IFC and core businesses, and  Peter Hadinger, previously President of our  U.S. Government Business Unit, steps up to  become our new Chief Technology Officer.  Susan Miller in consequence steps up to  become the President of our U.S. Government  Business Unit, bringing together our wholesale  and retail U.S. Government sales activities  under one roof, and stepping up onto Inmarsat’s  Executive Team. I am pleased to say that Phil,  Peter and Susan are all vastly experienced  and highly skilled operators in the satellite  industry and
