In 2017 Genel delivered  on that potential. I am now more confident than ever that,  while challenges remain, there is material  upside in the Genel portfolio and significant  opportunities ahead. As we enter 2018,  I believe that we have both the right strategy  to take advantage of these and the right  management team to deliver on that strategy. The macroeconomic climate altered again in  2017. On the positive side, the increase in the  oil price helped to boost cash flows from our  producing assets, and also provided a more  solid basis for the economy of the Kurdistan  Region of Iraq (‘KRI’). The unfortunate events  in the KRI in the last quarter of the year and  the subsequent material reduction in KRG  exports caused by these events significantly  disrupted the status quo. However, despite the  decrease in oil exports, the KRG continued to  demonstrate its ability and willingness to make  payments, and Genel has received payments  for sales on a monthly basis since September  2015. This has enabled investment by the  Company to continue. Financial strength  underpinning opportunity Genel is currently on a sound financial  footing, and continues to generate significant  free cash flow, something boosted by  the signing of the Receivable Settlement 4 STRATEGIC REPORT 2017 GROSS PRODUCTION (bopd)   Tawke – 105,460  Taq Tag – 18,050  Peshkabir – 3,590 CAPEX/OPEX FY2017 ($ million)   Tawke/Taq Taq cost recovered spend – 90  KRI – 18  Africa – 14 Taq Taq Tawke Override NET PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE KRG ($ MILLION)  2016: 207  263  10.9 9.1 5.6 10.9 6.0 5.7 12.1 6.4 5.2 14.0 6.6 4.7 11.1 6.7 11.9 7.4 11.6 8.4 12.0 11.0 14.0 14.9 13.1 9.1 11.6 13.2 9.6 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Jan 17 Feb 17 Mar 17 Apr 17 May 17 Jun 17 Jul 17 Aug 17 Sep 17 Oct 17 Nov 17 Dec 17 NET UNRISKED RESERVES  AND RESOURCES (MMboe)   Tawke and Taq Taq – 227  Bina Bawi and Miran – 2,911  Africa – 2,374 NET 2P RESERVES BY LICENCE (MMbbls)   Tawke – 107  Taq Taq – 24  Peshkabir – 19 WHERE WE OPERATE Genel at a glance  ANNUALREPORT2017 5  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION IRAQ IRAN TURKEY SYRIA MIRAN TAQ TAQ   TAWKE KRI EXPORT PIPELINE BINA BAWI PESHKABIR DJIBOUTI YEMEN PUNTLAND GULF OF ADEN ETHIOPIA SOMALILAND Block SL-10B/13 Odewayne ALGERIA MOROCCO Sidi Moussa   Oil and  gas assets   Exploration  and appraisal  assets  Oil production GENEL ENERGY 6 STRATEGIC REPORT A landmark year  of delivery Murat Özgül Chief Executive Officer 2017 was a successful year for Genel  Energy. We went into the year with  a clear focus, and took proactive  steps to deliver our key goals. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER’S  STATEMENT  ANNUALREPORT2017 7  STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION Prudent capital  allocation is at the core  of everything that we  do, and we spend each  dollar in a way that  creates the greatest  value for our  shareholders.  Delivering on our focus I was pleased to welcome Esa Ikaheimonen  as Chief Financial Officer and Bill Higgs as  Chief Operating Officer, both of whom bring  the qualities and experience to help us deliver  on these goals. A primary aim was to maximise the  generation of free cash flow from our  producing oil assets in the KRI. In the  year, monthly payments totalling $263  million were received from the KRG, with  our ongoing focus on cost and disciplined  capital allocation helping to convert  this into $142 million in free cash flow,  before bond interest payments.  This figure was boosted in the second half  of the year by additional proceeds received  under the RSA. This was a very positive deal  for Genel, and helped to fulfil our second aim  for 2017 of converting the receivable into  cash generation.  Writing off the past receivable in favour  of increased future cash flows helped to  simplify our balance sheet while significantly  increasing cash flow. Under the RSA, Genel  receives override payments of 4.5% of Tawke  gross PSC revenues for the five year period
