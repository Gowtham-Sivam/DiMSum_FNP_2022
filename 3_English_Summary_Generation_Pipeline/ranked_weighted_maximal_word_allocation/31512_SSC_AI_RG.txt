Profit before tax was $40.7m, compared to  $34.2m in 2016. This 19% increase reflects  a much lower exceptional charge of $0.5m  (2016: $2.9m) showing tangible benefit  from the successful completion of our  pension de-risking exercise. Basic earnings  per share increased by 18% to 103.15c. The Group ended the year in good  financial health with a cash balance of  $30.8m (2016: $21.7m), again reflecting  the low fixed capital requirements  and efficient working capital  characteristics of our business model. We have a distinct cultural identity within  4imprint, based on exacting standards  of customer service. The professionalism  and talent of our US team members  was demonstrated to great effect as  they helped our customers and affected  suppliers to recover in the aftermath of  Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. I would like to  thank each member of our dedicated team  for their remarkable efforts during the year. In several respects 2017 can be seen as  a year of consolidation and the starting  point of a transition for the Group. Our  market position was strengthened,  and our business model continued to  generate profitable organic revenue  growth. With our pension commitments  much reduced, we have a firm and  unencumbered financial base. Turning to the future development of  the Group, the Executive Team and the distributions as appropriate 06 4imprint Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT Chief Executive’s Review The 2017 financial results represent another year  of healthy, profitable organic growth. Performance in 2017 The North American business, which  comprises 97% of Group revenue,  continued to strengthen its position in  the US and Canadian markets. Revenue  growth over prior year was 12%, compared  to estimated total industry growth of  about 3%. Revenue growth in the second  half of the year was 14%, compared to  11% in the first half, in keeping with  the phasing of marketing initiatives. Reported revenue growth for the UK  business was up 11% over prior year. In  base currency the growth rate was 16%,  outpacing that of the UK market and  indicative of a strengthening customer file. In total 1,185,000 orders – each customised  and carrying an “on-time or free”  guarantee – were processed in the year.  Orders from new customers were up 5%  over 2016, with more than 252,000 new  customers acquired. Orders from existing  customers were up 16%, as retention  rates remained strong and consistent. Our organic growth is driven through  disciplined investment in innovative, data- driven marketing. In 2017, online marketing  spend continued to grow at a faster rate  than the overall marketing budget, although  our offline activities grew year-over-year  as well. Our customer retention strategy  was underpinned by our unique Blue Box™  marketing programme, which continues to  evolve to support a growing
