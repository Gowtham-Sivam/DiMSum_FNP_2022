We have also  developed Energy and Aviation  platforms to deliver our targets  to 2018 and beyond. The Group  is now uniquely placed as an  entrepreneurial public limited  company that creates value,  supported by its strong heritage  in logistics and systems and  with a real focus on delivering  great customer service. With a  market capitalisation of close to  £800m, a strong balance sheet  and a progressive dividend  policy, the Group is well placed  to continue to deliver strong  returns to shareholders for the  foreseeable future.
