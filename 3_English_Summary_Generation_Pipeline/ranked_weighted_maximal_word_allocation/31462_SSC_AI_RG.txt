During the second half of FY17, we  completed refurbishments of existing  estate sites in line with our plans at Derby,  Swansea and Leamington Spa, together  with a refurbishment at Ipswich (acquired  in FY16). In total, across both the existing  estate and acquired sites, six sites benefitted  from Tenpinisation and refurbishment  investment during FY17 at a total cost  of £1.3m. During FY18 we will continue  to invest in our sites, including a planned  refurbishment and extension of our  site in Fountain Park, and selective,  return-focused, investment in  refurbishments at a small number  of further sites in the existing estate.  Finally, on investment expenditure,  and in line with our previous guidance,  we completed the installation of the  innovative Pins & Strings technology at  a further five sites (Croydon, Parrs Wood,  Northampton, Glasgow and Derby) during  the second half of FY17 at a total cost of  £1.0m.
