Group turnover for the year to 30 June 2002 was up 7% to £149.5m (2001: £140.3m). Acquisitions contributed 1% of turnover growth. Operating profit before exceptional items amounted to £9.2m (2001: £8.1m), an increase of 14%.  Operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items increased by 14% to £ 11.3m (2001: £9.9m). Profit before tax, goodwill amor- tisation and exceptional items was £10.9m (2001: £9.6m), up 13%. After tax and minority interests basic earnings per share is calculated at 3.5p (2001: 27.9p), down 87%. Adjusted earnings per share, earnings being adjusted for goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, rose 10% to 36.9p (2001: 33.4p). During the year the core EDC (Electronic Document Capture) Division continued to bene- fit from its position as the leading global partner for EDC products and services with a significant level of new contract gains. In the face of very challenging global IT market condi- tions EDC continued its growth record and expanded its market position by new product launches and additional partnership agreements. The SGA (Samsung General Agency) Division experienced declining turnover rates in difficult trading conditions, but maintained an acceptable, albeit lower, level of operating profit contribution. FINANCIAL POSITION Due to its cash generative business model the Group generated cash flow from operations of £14.0m (2001: £8.4m) and ended the year with net funds of £3.8m (net debt of £0.7m at 30 June 2001). The Group spent £1.7m in cash on acquisitions and other investments during the year . OPERATING REVIEW The EDC Division is DICOM Group’s largest division, representing 82% of profits. It develops and sells software and electronic components, provides a broad range of EDC services and distributes key related products to over 1,000 system integrators and software houses in more than 60 countries world-wide. EDC solutions offer end users high returns on investment by allowing data and document intensive organisations to reduce business 6 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 2000           2001           2002 EDC                          SGA                           Other           Turnover in £m CHAIRMAN’ S S TA TEMENT The EDC Division contributed £9.3m (2001: £7 .0m) operating profit, an increase of 33%. This represents 82% of DICOM Group’s total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. During the year EDC also launched a number of new products and entered new partnership arrangements, which will enable the Group to address new areas of the EDC market. The SGA Division continued to experience difficult trading conditions, particularly in Austria. Turnover fell by 8% to £47.5m (2001: £51.5m), but SGA contributed 18% of DICOM Group’s total operating profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items. EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES As previously announced DICOM Group has incurred certain costs during the year, which have been treated as exceptional charges. Following the default on 1 April 2002 of a scheduled consideration payment DICOM Group has reviewed its overall exposure in relation to a non-core investment disposed of in early 2000. A provision of £4m (with no adverse future cash flow implications) is considered necessary. This sum is treated as an exceptional item. The residual exposure is secured by 450,000 DICOM Group shares, currently held in escrow.  DICOM Group had to write off a trade debt owed by a US distributor, which discontinued business activities in early December 2001, resulting in an exceptional charge of £1.2m.  DICOM Group’s business prospects in the US have not been materially adversely affected by the discontinuance of the US distributor. DICOM Group markets its products and services through an extensive network of ISV’s (Independent Software Vendors) and resellers and is therefore not overly dependent on any specific distributor. DICOM Group has appointed four distributors in the US and has authorised more than 1,000 resellers worldwide to integrate and market its products.
