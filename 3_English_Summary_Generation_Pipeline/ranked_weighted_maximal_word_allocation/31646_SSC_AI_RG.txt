This has been delivered through a mix of organic and  acquisitive growth. Demand for certain of Gooch & Housego’s products, particularly  from the microelectronics and undersea fibre optic  communications sectors, reached unprecedented levels during  the year. The resulting record order book presented a significant  challenge for some of the Company’s manufacturing operations.  Investments made in recent years in “lean manufacturing” and  “continuous improvement” meant that G&H was in part able to  respond to this demand through an enhanced ability to match  capacity with demand across the Company’s various  manufacturing locations. Combined with significant investments  during the year in people, and in the latest manufacturing  equipment, these initiatives made it possible to satisfy the needs  of our customers and begin to reduce lead times towards the  year-end. In February 2017 G&H acquired StingRay Optics LLC (StingRay),  a USA based designer and manufacturer of specialist optical and  opto-mechanical systems. StingRay was a particularly significant  acquisition as it provides G&H with advanced optical systems  design capabilities for harsh and demanding applications. These  new capabilities support the Company’s twin strategic objectives  of moving up the value chain and achieving greater diversification  by enabling G&H to provide systems-level solutions to  Aerospace & Defence (“A&D”) customers. In 2017 the StingRay  acquisition helped sales into the A&D sector approach one third  of total revenues. StingRay has delivered a consistently strong  performance since acquisition. The acquisitions completed in the  previous year (Alfalight and Kent Periscopes) also made valuable  contributions in 2017. The investment in people during 2017 represents an important  enhancement of the skills-base of G&H, and bodes well for the  future. In order to meet the challenges of greater scale and  complexity G&H ANNUAL REPORT 2017  |  11 STRA TEGIC REPORT Overview FY2017 Performance Gooch & Housego (“G&H”) benefited from positive market  conditions and strong demand across its main sectors of  industrials, aerospace & defence (“A&D”) and life sciences.  Demand was particularly high for critical components used in  microelectronic manufacturing and high reliability fibre couplers  used in undersea cable networks.  FY 2017 has been a ‘watershed’ year for the company, as we  passed through the £100 million sales barrier for the first time.  Revenue of £112.0 million represents year on year growth of  30.2%, or on a constant currency basis 18.7%. Adjusted PBT,  which is less affected by foreign exchange fluctuations due to  the natural hedging within the business, was £16.1 million,  equating to a year on year profit growth of 13.7%. Strategically important investments in people, processes, systems  and the latest capital equipment were made during the year,  enabling us to address high levels of demand in FY2017 and  provide an important platform for G&H’s future growth. Strategic Goals Considerable progress has been made towards our strategic  goals of further diversification and moving up the value chain.  A&D and life sciences both provide a counter balance to the  exposure that the industrial laser sector has to the global  economic cycle. These business areas have customer bases which  include tier one A&D and medical diagnostic companies, who  often prefer G&H to provide sub systems or systems rather than  solely critical components, providing a strong impetus to move  up the value chain. When coupled with the regulatory hurdles  inherent in both A&D and life sciences, these markets provide  a defensible business model with a high barrier to entry.  Our aim is to establish a ‘critical mass’ of business in both the  A&D and life science sectors. This has in large part been
