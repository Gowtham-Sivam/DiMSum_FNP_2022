Being able to visualise data isn’t enough today. Senior executives need to be  able to look into the future. This is why business and IT leaders are actively  searching for new technologies that deliver more insight, and faster.  For organisations to survive, business transformation must be prioritised. With its growing capabilities, following the acquisition of Integritie  in May 2017, Rosslyn Data Technologies is well positioned to become the go-to company for organisations seeking to accelerate business  outcomes by creating new opportunities from data. Welcome to the world of intelligent event-driven analytics. Rosslyn Data Technologies has built a powerful platform that provides more than just  business insight; the data used by customers for reporting and analysis automatically informs users of what decisions must be taken next.

The platform we have built over the  last three years has received significant accolades  this year, culminating in receiving a Microsoft  Data Platform of the Year finalist accreditation  in October 2016, confirming our belief that the  progress we have made in developing a  cloud-based solution is significant. This year, growing both our partnerships and our  direct sales client base has been both challenging  and rewarding. We deployed a significant element  of the IPO funds into our partnership, sales and  marketing strategies, whilst ensuring we did  not miss any developments that would enable  the business to transform to profitability and  organic cash generation. As previously reported,  the progress this year was not as rapid as we  would have liked; Brexit, the US presidential  election and difficult trading times for some of  our Partners and clients has led to a  slowdown in the delivery of some larger  contracts. Group revenue £3.6m (2016: £3.9m).  Despite this we have been able to manage  our cost base and we are now able to see  a timeline when cash Rosslyn Data Technologies plc / Annual report and accounts 2017 /  07 Since the year end we have completed our  strategic investment in Integritie (UK) Limited  and raised additional cash to enable us to take  the Company through to positive EBITDA.” Roger Bullen, Chief Executive Officer Strategy This year we continued to focus on implementing  our strategic plan, broadening our appeal to  organisations hungry for data analytics, broader  data insights and increasing the number of  strategic partners. In addition, this year we also  included looking into a “buy and build” strategy  to identify new and alternative technologies that  were available in the market for managing and  handling complex unstructured data solutions  to sit alongside our structured data capabilities. During the year we made new investments  in developing our product suite on the RAPid  platform, adding new tools and functionality  to the mix whilst ensuring the RAPid platform is  scalable and user friendly and provides a satisfying  user experience for our partners and clients.  We also invested funds in the development of  an HR analytics product suite utilising the core  technologies from our other applications and  demonstrating the versatility of the platform. We continued to focus the funds raised at IPO  to increase our sales capabilities. Recruitment  of quality people with the requisite knowledge  and experience continues to be a challenge,  but we have maintained our sales headcount  levels through the year, and where possible will  continue to add to the sales and partnership  business development teams necessary to fulfil
