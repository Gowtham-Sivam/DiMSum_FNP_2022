O U 08 GYG plc Annual report and financial statements 2017 09 Overview C H I EF E X E C U T IV E’ S R EP O R T REMY MILLOTT   Chief Executive Officer 10 GYG plc I am pleased to report on GYG’s first year end results as a public limited  company. Our successful IPO in July 2017 was a major milestone for the  Group, further strengthening its position as the global market leader in the  superyacht painting, supply and maintenance sector. Together with the  acquisition of the majority shareholding in ACA Marine, GYG’s flotation on  AIM represented a significant achievement for the Board of our Company  and I am grateful for the dedicated support of my fellow Directors. The Group delivered strong results with revenue of ¤62.6m   in the year ended 31 December 2017 reflecting a 14.7% increase  compared to FY16, and adjusted EBITDA of ¤7.2m (FY16:  ¤6.7m), an increase of 7.6%. We ended the year with cash of  ¤6.2m on a par with the previous year and a stronger balance  sheet, having repaid ¤4.3m of loan notes post the IPO.   This was achieved alongside a busy corporate agenda and  challenging market conditions in the latter half of the year.  Strong revenue growth was achieved in the first half, however  as previously announced, the third quarter refit programme  was affected by the disruption to seasonal cruising patterns  from an extraordinary sequence of hurricanes. This caused  delays to several major projects, leading to a softening of  revenues in the second half of the year. Despite this, I am  pleased to report that refit showed a strong recovery in the  fourth quarter and as far as we can see these project deferrals  resulted in work being postponed into 2018. The Group is well  positioned with a strong forward Order Book in a market  segment which continues to exhibit solid growth. STRATEGY The Group’s strategy remains the same as that detailed in our  Admission Document and we will continue to leverage our  market leadership in the refit sector where GYG holds a 30%  share (up from 29% at the time of flotation), an 86% customer  retention rate, and a preferred supplier status with many of the  leading refit shipyards in the core locations. Our addressable  coating market is forecast to grow at 6% per annum and we  have the platform in place to grow with and above the market.  The Group is targeting regional developments in the refit  market by continuing to engage and enter into new agreements  with shipyards, further strengthening our market position.  The Group aims to increase its market share in new build  through an organic growth strategy. The Board believes that  being a listed group provides reassurance to shipyards due   to the scale and security of the Group and provides
