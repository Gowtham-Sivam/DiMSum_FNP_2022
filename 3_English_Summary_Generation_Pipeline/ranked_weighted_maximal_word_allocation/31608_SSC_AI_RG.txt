The  Board remains focused on executing  the Group’s established strategy  which is designed to deliver strong  growth in earnings and shareholder  value over the economic cycle. The Group has a long track record  of consistent delivery against its key  performance metrics by compounding  stable “GDP plus” underlying growth  with carefully selected, value enhancing  acquisitions, funded by the Group’s  free cash flow. This strategy has been  successfully designed and executed  under the outstanding leadership of  Bruce Thompson since he became  CEO of Diploma PLC in 1996. Over the  last 15 years, since emerging from a  major restructuring of the Group led  by Bruce, the Group has delivered  strong double-digit growth in earnings, will be made in the next financial year. 04 Diploma PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 STRATEGIC REPORT North American revenues (by destination) by Sector Group revenue 41 % European revenues (by destination) by Sector Group revenue 48 % Rest of World revenues (by destination) by Sector Group revenue 11 % OVERVIEW Group at a Glance W ell diversified by geography  and business area Healthcare (84% of revenues) Clinical diagnostic instrumentation, consumables and services  supplied to hospital pathology and life sciences laboratories for  the testing of blood, tissue and other samples.

The businesses target stable “GDP  plus” underlying revenue growth over  the business cycle with sustainable  attractive margins and then convert  the profit into strong free cash flow by  tightly managing working capital and  focused capital investments. The free  cash flow generated then funds healthy  growing dividends and selective value  enhancing acquisitions which accelerate  growth in revenues and profit to double- digit levels. The strategy consistently  delivers a return in excess of 20%  pre-tax on total capital invested and  steadily increasing shareholder value. Business model and KPIs Stable and resilient “GDP plus” underlying  revenue growth is achieved through  our focus on essential products and  services funded by customers’ operating  rather than capital budgets and supplied  across a range of specialised industry  segments. By supplying essential  solutions, not just products, we build  strong long term relationships with our  customers and suppliers, which support  sustainable and attractive margins.  Finally, we encourage an entrepreneurial  culture in our businesses through our  decentralised management structure.  These essential values ensure that  decisions are made close to the customer  and that the businesses are agile and  responsive to changes
