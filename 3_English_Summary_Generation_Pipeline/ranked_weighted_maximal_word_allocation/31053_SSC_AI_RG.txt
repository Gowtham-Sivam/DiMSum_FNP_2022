Xibis revenues Strategic Report / Chairman’s Statement SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 05 EARLIER OPTIMISM JUSTIFIED  In my report for 2016, I advised that, given the  strength of our then current order book and  short-term pipeline, we anticipated that the  growth we were seeing would continue into  at least the first half of 2017. We also noted  that, in keeping with the pattern over previous  years, we anticipated that our second half- year financial performance in 2017 would be  substantially stronger than the first half. This was, indeed, the case and I am pleased  to report that our optimism and guidance was  well placed. The Group delivered a strong  overall performance in 2017, with results for  full-year revenues and adjusted profits being  comfortably in line with guidance. It is also  pleasing to report a positive advance on net  margins, which is in line with our strategic  objectives. Going into 2018 the outlook continues to be  very encouraging. The positive news flow across the year on  new business wins was crowned by the  announcement in late October of the award  of a €18m contract with OHB System AG  to deliver the ground station control and  communications infrastructure for Heinrich  Hertz, the German national satellite- communications mission. Further contract  wins across the Group in the last quarter of  2017 also meant that we entered 2018 with a  record order book of £91.3m. Operational cash flows were very healthy  across the year, resulting in further reductions  in net debt and underpinning a healthy 10%  uplift in the recommended final dividend  payment. With the acquisition of the ANNOVA  Systems GmbH (“Annova”) business our  income streams (which are predominantly in  £ sterling and €) are well balanced, providing  an internal hedge against exchange-rate  movements. We do not anticipate any major  impact on profitability in 2018 from currency  fluctuations or hedging Strategic Report / Chief Executive’s Review SCISYS PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2017 07 2017: A STEP CHANGE FOR SCISYS  TOWARDS ITS MEDIUM-TERM  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES In last year’s report I expressed my confidence  based on the progress achieved in 2016 that  we would be able to continue our sustainable,  resilient and balanced growth in 2017. I am delighted to confirm that we have ended  the period with record revenues of £57.2m (up  25%), an adjusted operating profit of £4.6m  (up 44%) and adjusted operating margin of  8%. This is a step change in our performance  and it brings us closer to our medium-term  objectives of £60m in revenues and a double- digit margin. Two major elements have  contributed to this improved performance: •  Annova, the Munich-based newsroom  solutions specialist, has contributed its first  full year to the Group’s results. •  The other divisions have contributed a  very healthy 9% organic revenue growth  during 2017, based on a strong second half  year, which is in line with our expectations  expressed in September 2017. Across all of our divisions we have seen major  new contract wins, which in aggregate have  lifted our order book to more than £91.3m –  another record achieved in 2017. The sales  success story was epitomised late in 2017 by  the notable win by our Space division, which  secured a contract worth €18m to deliver the  complete ground-control infrastructure for the  German Heinrich Hertz mission.  Of this total order book value, £36.5m is for  delivery in 2018. This underpins our optimistic  outlook for the year ahead and strongly  reinforces the confidence that our medium- term objectives are within reach. Enterprise Solutions & Defence (ESD)  The ESD division delivered a strong second  half, with its contribution up by 35% and  revenues up by 9% on the first six months  and thus making up for a slower first half.
