In just two quarters since its launch,  more than 8,000 customers have purchased Intercept X  on the Sophos Central cloud-management platform. WORLD-CLASS PRODUCTS AND INNOVATION A commitment to industry-leading innovation, focused  on our target customer, combined with a strong  demand backdrop and an increasingly powerful channel  ecosystem enabled Sophos to continue to gain market  share, outpacing market growth rates in both enduser  and network security. In addition to the launch of Intercept X, there was an  enthusiastic response to the newest release of the  Sophos XG Firewall, helping the Group achieve 17.8  percent growth in network security billings for the  year, at constant currency. With version 16.0 launched  in October 2016, customers are benefiting from over  100 new features and significant enhancements to  the user experience, particularly navigation, policy  management and logging, as well as additional  synchronized security features linking the XG firewall  with endpoint, encryption, mobile, and other security  offerings. Sophos is already a leader in the emerging  cloud-based infrastructure market for security, a  growing opportunity as enterprises adopt infrastructure  as a service via the cloud. XG Firewall version 16.0  introduced support for the Microsoft Azure cloud  platform in addition to the existing support for Amazon  Web Services. ACQUISITIONS In February 2017 Sophos announced the acquisition of  Invincea, Inc., a leading developer of advanced next- generation malware protection, consistently ranked  as among the best performing signature-less, next- generation endpoint technologies in third-party testing,  rated highly both for high detection and low false- positive rates. The Invincea endpoint security portfolio  prevents, detects, and remediates zero-day and  sophisticated attacks, and combines neural-network  based machine learning and behavioural monitoring to  enhance detection through artificial intelligence and  stop evasive malware before damage occurs. Invincea complements and enhances Sophos’ existing  presence in next-generation endpoint protection,
