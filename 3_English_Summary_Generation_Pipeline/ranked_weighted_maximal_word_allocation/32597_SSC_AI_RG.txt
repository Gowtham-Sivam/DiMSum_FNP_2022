When writing this statement last year,   our revenue growth expectation for the  year ahead was 37%, and the 58% growth  we actually achieved reflects the huge  effort made by our staff right across the  business, from the Board of Directors  and senior management, through to our  customer service and warehouse teams. International growth of 124% has been  particularly pleasing, and this is an area   in which we will continue to invest  significant effort and resource to improve  and increase our global reach, building  on the early success of our recently  launched Swedish and German  distribution operations. Notwithstanding the investment  necessary for our next phase of  expansion, the Board remains focused  on delivering profitable growth, and   as such is pleased to announce an  operating profit of £2.6m which is a  £1.7m (+192%) improvement on FY16’s  underlying operating profit (adjusted   to remove one-off IPO costs). This  translates into net profit of £2.3m   and earnings per share of 11.5 pence. In many ways, this has been a  transformational year for the business,  and to effectively manage further   growth and operational complexities   the Group formed an Operational   Board on 1 March 2017 to support and  complement the plc Board, comprising   a wide breadth and depth of operational  and commercial experience. To ensure we remain positioned for  further growth, the Group requires  additional head office capacity, and   the Board is delighted to announce a  property acquisition that provides an  excellent long-term solution to our  growth needs in our home city of York. In 2012, private equity firm Key Capital  Partners invested into the business,   and in October 2016 sold its final  shareholding. On behalf of the Board   I would like to thank them and Peter  Armitage, who represented Key Capital  on our and destination of the goods being purchased 14 Gear4music (Holdings) plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 CHIEF  EXECUTIVE’S  STATEMENT I am delighted to report  on a year that saw  record sales and profits  whilst continuing to  invest in the key  strategic areas that  further improve our  customer proposition. Andrew Wass Chief Executive Officer Introduction When we joined AIM in June 2015, we  were very confident that, with continued  targeted investment of the funds from  our IPO, we could build on the £24m  revenues we had achieved in FY15, by  improving our customer proposition  through strategic investment into staff,  systems, inventory and marketing, and  expanding our presence in Europe.   I am thrilled that we have surpassed  those expectations, having more than  doubled our revenues to £56m, whilst  increasing profitability to an all-time high. Business review We continue to make good progress on  both our financial and commercial KPIs  in our second year as a listed business: Financial KPIs FY17 FY16 Revenue (Note 2) £56.1m £35.5m (+58%) UK revenue (Note 2) £34.8m £26.0m (+34%) International revenue (Note 2) £21.3m £9.5m (+124%) EBITDA 1 £3.6m £1.1m (+236%) Underlying EBITDA 1 £3.6m £1.7m (+112%) Operating profit 1 £2.6m £0.3m Underlying operating profit 1  £2.6m £0.9m (+192%)  Cash at year end £3.0m £3.5m (-14%) Commercial KPIs FY17 FY16 Website visitors 12.6m 10.1m Conversion rate 2.75% 2.28% Average order value £124 £116 Active customers 340,000      226,000 Products listed 37,100 31,500 1  Underlying profit measures for FY16 are shown before £0.6m of IPO-related costs – see Note 3 for  reconciliation to IFRS profit measures.

There’s more to   do and we’re learning from   our experiences, but I am very  pleased with how
