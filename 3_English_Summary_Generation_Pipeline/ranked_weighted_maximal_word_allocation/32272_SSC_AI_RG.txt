Since joining the Group in January 2017,  I have spent time getting to know our  two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel  Education. Both have leading positions  in their respective markets and have  strategies to build on the progress of  recent years, evolving their operating  models to cater for their customers’  future demands and ways of shopping.  I’m excited about the opportunity for  sustainable growth in a marketplace  for value‑ conscious customers who are  rapidly moving their purchases online,  although there is a significant amount of  further work required to achieve that goal. The new executive management team  that we announced at the start of April  2017, led by Phil Maudsley, have a wealth  of relevant experience that will be used to  deliver this growth.

We  are making that process seamless for  customers by investing to ensure that we  always have online channels that meet  their expectations. We also have to be alert to changing  patterns of use and expectation of service  levels. 63% of Express Gifts’ customers  ordered online last year. However, in  Spring this year we have seen over 80%  of our new customers that we have  recruited placing their first orders online.  At some point in the future we will see  this figure inevitably approaching 100%.  We are planning now for the investment  and transformation required to keep pace  with this digital evolution. Maximising our potential Broadly speaking, our businesses have  operated on a standalone basis over the  last few years, with little focus on Group  synergies. This was logical at a time when  the smaller business units may have  been under consideration for disposal.  However, with the Group structure now  established, we can see several areas  going forward where we can better  utilise our resources to drive value and  efficiency. We are already working on  two areas of opportunity. Firstly, we have  moved our small plc‑ team from Hyde  (where Findel Education is headquartered)  to Accrington (where Express Gifts is  based). By doing this, we can
