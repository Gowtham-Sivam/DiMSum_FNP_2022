Net Debt at the year-end was £141m, also better than  our guidance at the start of the year. This equates to  EBITDA leverage of 1.4x, well within our medium-term  target range of 1–2x and comfortably below the 3.5x  debt covenant requirement. You can read more about the drivers of financial  performance in the Chief Executive’s Review, with  further detail provided in the Divisional Reviews on  pages 44 to 49 and the Finance Review on pages 50   to 68.  Targeting further progress As we look ahead to 2018, we expect Underlying  Trading Profit to grow to around £80m on revenues of  £2.8–2.9bn. Since the second half of 2016, we have been  making progress on increasing our profit margin – a key  deliverable of successfully implementing our strategy  – and in 2018 we expect that further margin and profit  progress will be driven largely by transformation savings. Looking further ahead, we expect 2019 to be a year of  further good growth in Underlying Trading Profit, which  is again likely to be driven by additional transformation  savings. As we have said previously, the rate of growth  thereafter will be more dependent on our ability to  grow revenues. The Strategy Review announced in  March 2015 set out a long term ambition that the  business could grow in line with a market which was  expected to expand at a long term trend rate of 5–7% a  year and deliver margins of 5–6%. Our margin ambition  was predicated on three conditions: first, reducing  costs as a percentage of sales; second, containing  losses on onerous contracts and converting a number  of them into profitable contracts on rebid; and, thirdly,  increasing margins by growing revenues whilst bearing  down on overheads. We Serco Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 32 How we performed Year ended 31 December 2017 2016 Revenue – continuing and discontinued operations (1) £2,953.6m £3,047.8m Reported Revenue (continuing operations only) (1) £2,953.6m £3,011.0m Underlying Trading Profit (UTP) (2) £69.8m £82.1m Reported Operating Profit (after exceptional items; continuing operations only) (2) £30.0m £42.2m Underlying EPS, basic (3) 3.42p 4.13p Reported EPS, basic (after exceptional items; continuing and discontinued operations) (0.02p) (0.11p) Free Cash Flow (4) (£6.7m) (£33.0m) Net Debt £141.1m £109.3m Notes to summary table of financial results: (1)  Revenue is as defined under current IFRS (before adoption of IFRS15), which excludes Serco’s share of revenue of its joint ventures and associates. Revenue  including that from discontinued operations (£nil in 2017 and £36.8m in 2016) is shown for consistency with previous disclosures. Reported Revenue excludes  revenue from discontinued operations. Organic revenue growth is the change at constant currency after adjusting to exclude the impact of relevant  acquisitions or disposals. Change at constant currency is calculated by translating non-Sterling values for the year ended 31 December 2017 into Sterling at  the average exchange rate for the year ended 31 December 2016. (2)  Trading Profit is defined as IFRS Operating Profit adjusted for (i) amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on acquisition and (ii) exceptional items;  it includes the impact of discontinued operations in 2016. Consistent with IFRS, it includes Serco’s share of profit after interest and tax of its joint ventures  and associates. Underlying Trading Profit additionally excludes Contract & Balance Sheet Review adjustments (principally Onerous Contract Provision (OCP)  releases or charges), as well as the beneficial treatment of depreciation and amortisation of assets held for sale during 2016, and other material one-time  items such as the pension scheme settlement in the first half of 2016 related to the profit on early exit from a UK local authority contract that occurred in the  second half of 2015.
