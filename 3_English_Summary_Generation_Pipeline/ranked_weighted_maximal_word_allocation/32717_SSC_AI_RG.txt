GBGI Annual Report 2017 02 Strategic Report Chairman’s statement Overview I am delighted to introduce the maiden Annual Report and  Accounts for GBGI for the year ending 30 June 2017. It has  been a landmark year for the Company, having achieved  a successful AIM listing in February 2017. This report covers  the performance of the Group’s pre listing parent Saxton  Lane from 1 July 2016 to 21 February 2017 and GBGI  Limited from 22 February 2017 to 30 June 2017. Building  on our proven growth track record, the Group grew gross  written premiums to in excess of $183.5 million for the  first time in its history, with revenue for the year growing  over 23 percent.  This performance has been achieved against the  demanding backdrop of preparing the business for its  admission to AIM and the consequent transition of the  business to comply with the high-governance and ethical  standards of the QCA Corporate Governance Code for  Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies.  Over the past year we have delivered a strong financial  performance, further strengthening our balance sheet  and declaring a maiden dividend. Progressive change Reflecting on 2017 I am pleased with the significant strides  made by GBGI. We have delivered on our business plans  and have continued to distribute and underwrite medical,  life and disability, and travel insurance across over  120 jurisdictions worldwide. The completion of our  AIM listing earlier this year was a landmark event for the  business. The funds raised have improved an already  robust capital position, with our solvency coverage ratio  standing at 150.4 percent at 30 June 2017 and A.M. Best,  the ratings agency, upgrading its outlook on GBGI’s  Financial Strength rating in July 2017. The positive  reputational benefits from the listing have already  been felt in terms of commercial momentum.  Bill Ward Non-Executive Chairman GBGI Annual Report 2017 03 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Strategic and operational evolution During of over $183.5 million gross written premiums. GBGI Annual Report 2017 04 Strategic Report Chief Executive Officer’s statement The year to 30 June 2017 was transformative for GBGI, with  the strategic progress made by the business over the years  reflected in a successful listing on AIM in February 2017. The Group has successfully carved out a differentiated  niche in the global benefits market, offering the global  reach of the multinational insurers combined with the  flexibility and customer responsiveness of local brokers  and managing agents. This differentiated proposition,  underpinned by our international network of distribution  partners, has propelled the ongoing growth of the  business. We are careful to ensure that the levels of  customer service exceed expectations and by operating  across the value chain we seek to maintain close control  over the service. Over the past year we have benefitted from our focus  on niche markets underserved by our competitors,  and remain the only insurer quoted on the London  Stock Exchange that derives all of its revenues from  the international medical, life, disability and travel  insurance markets. Strong financial performance Gross written premiums (“GWP”) grew 19.4 percent to   $183.5 million, driven by moderate rate increases and  growth in policy count. An increase in the business we  retain on balance sheet, underpinned by our consistent  loss ratio track record, drove higher net earned premiums,  up 29.3 percent to $91.4 million. Overall net revenues grew  24.2 percent to $134.3 million. Our commitment to delivering underwriting profit to our  reinsurers enabled by the quality of our underwriting  operations and data history, led to continued strong  insurance profits for the year. With the business growing  rapidly we are focused on ensuring the appropriate level  of investment in the operational infrastructure of the  business. Investment in operations, including in staffing  levels and training, led to the expense ratio increasing to  29.6 percent (FY 2016: 28.6 percent). This investment in  growth will enable
