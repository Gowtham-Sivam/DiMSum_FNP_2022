 TAG programme is on track; during 2017 we have  assembled the right team, structure and processes  that we believe will lead to success. Even at this early  stage, we are clearly seeing the benefits of our TAG  initiatives, through growth in our Core events and  forward bookings.  ITE is well placed to realise its vision of creating the  world’s leading portfolio of content-driven, must-attend  events that deliver an outstanding experience and ROI  for our customers. A fast pace has been set in the last  year which we look forward to continuing into 2018   and beyond.” Mark Shashoua, CEO of ITE Group plc Financial statements Governance Strategic report  02 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 03  ITE Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 02 ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 40% 24% 9% 20% 7% Volumes by division (%)  Russia  Asia  Central Asia  Eastern & S Europe  Brands 47% 16% 14% 11% 12% Revenues by division (%)  Russia  Asia  Central Asia  Eastern & S Europe  Brands 53% 14% 13% 9% 11% Headline proﬁt before  tax by division (%)  Russia  Asia  Central Asia  Eastern & Southern Europe  Brands Strategic report Our operating divisions Russia  Key sectors Build & Interiors, Food & Packaging,  Manufacturing Industrial Technology,  Advanced Technologies  m 2  sold (000s) 274 (2016: 256) Revenue £71.4m (2016: £51.6m) Headline profit before tax £26.3m   (2016: £19.8m) Asia  Key sectors Build & Interiors, Manufacturing Industrial  Technology, Connect  m 2  sold (000s) 1 60 (2016: 125) Revenue £23.8m (2016: £17.1m) Headline profit before tax £6.9m (2016: £5.5m) Central Asia  Key sectors Build & Interiors, Energy, Food  & Packaging    m 2  sold (000s) 64 (2016: 70) Revenue £21. 7m (2016: £22.0m) Headline profit before tax £6.5m (2016: £7.0m) Eastern & Southern  Europe Key sectors Build & Interiors, Travel & Tourism, Beauty  & Healthcare, Food & Packaging    m Chairman’s   Statement ITE is entering a period in the  transformation that requires dynamic  change. The Group has embraced the  change to date with a renewed energy  and an appetite for success, which is  shared by the Board. I am pleased to introduce to shareholders  the Group’s Annual Report for the year  ended 30 September 2017. These results  demonstrate a return to growth in a year of  substantial change. A new vision for ITE This was Mark Shashoua’s first full year as  Chief Executive Officer and Andrew Beach  joined early in the year as Chief Financial  Officer. The new executive team and the  Board have undertaken a full strategic  review of the business to identify the  optimum way forward for the Group. This  review involved a number of specialist  advisors working together with the senior  management team, covering every aspect  of the business and the recommendations  were carefully considered by the Board. The result of the review, unveiled in May,  is an evolved strategy for the Group to  generate organic growth focussed around  our market-leading events. This will involve  significant investment in event content  and marketing with the intention to make  our leading shows ‘must-visit’ events  in their market sectors. The Group has  also adopted a new ‘sales-led’ culture  to drive revenue and has invested in a  central best practice team to ensure that  the Group is consistent in delivering a  high-quality experience for exhibitors  and visitors alike anywhere in the world. Our TAG programme, which will see the  Group invest up to £20m over the next  three years with anticipated strong return  on investment by 2020, was presented  to a number of shareholders in May and  we were pleased with the support it  received. You will find more detail in the  Chief Executive Officer’s Statement. Performance Revenue was £152.6m (2016: £134.4m),  growth of 5% on a like-for-like basis. This  is the first year of like-for-like revenue  growth for four years and a pleasing  result from the implementation of the first  initiatives of the Group’s new strategy.  As expected, headline profit before tax  was lower at £31.6m (2016: £36.5m) after  the planned investment in the new TAG  programme. Loss before tax was £3.2m  (2016: loss of £4.1m). Net debt has been  reduced by 16% to £49.7m (2016: £59.1m).  In Russia, and in particular in Moscow,  there are good signs that the economy is  improving after the geopolitical issues of  recent years, yet we are still experiencing  challenges in many of our other markets. Dividends Full year dividend cover has been  maintained at more than two times  headline earnings per share. The full  year dividend per share is proposed  at 4.0p (2016: 4.5p). With the current  lower levels of Group profit and the  TAG programme investment the Board  believes this to be in the long-term  interests of shareholders. The final  dividend of 2.5p is proposed for payment  on 5 February 2018 to shareholders  on the register on 5 January 2018. Board The Board recognise that strong  corporate governance is at the heart of  a good business. We remain focussed  on implementing robust processes that  identify and mitigate risk and deliver best  practice in the context of delivering on  our promises to all of our stakeholders. After five years’ tenure, Marco Sodi stepped  down from the Board at the end of the  financial year, having stepped down as  Company Chairman in July 2017. Marco
