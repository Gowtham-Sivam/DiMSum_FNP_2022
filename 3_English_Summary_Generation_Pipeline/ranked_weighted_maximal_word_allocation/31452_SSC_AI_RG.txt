Relentless traffic growth Cisco forecasts that global Chairman’s statement Spirent thrives on the challenges of  helping our customers to manage  the complexity of their networks  and services while they seek to  dramatically reduce costs.  I took on the role of Chairman after the  AGM in May 2017. In my time on the Board  I have been impressed by our industry  leading technology and believe that we  have a compelling value proposition for  our customers. I have been even more  impressed by the calibre and commitment  of our people who are truly passionate  about delivering value for our customers  and shareholders. It is thanks to them  that Spirent is so well respected in the  industries it serves. The Board believes that the opportunity to  bridge across from the laboratory to live  operations represents a major opportunity  for Spirent. In order to realise our full  potential we require a relentless focus  on our go to market strategy, excellent  customer service and our market leading  products and solutions. In the last few years, Spirent has seen a  huge amount of change in its markets, with  the polarisation of the smartphone industry,  the consolidation of major network  equipment manufacturers and the sudden  Chief Executive Officer’s strategic review Spirent has adapted to the changes  in the test and measurement  industry and is aligned with the new  opportunities that have been created. Overview – realising our potential In 2017, we have established a firm basis  to realise Spirent’s potential.  We focused on our core expertise to  enable our customers to develop high- performance, high-security systems in a  shorter time. We have taken our expertise  in service assurance to deploy innovative  new systems, winning new business with  well-established and new customers.  In doing so, we gained market share  with the early adopters in the industry,  which should serve Spirent well in 2018  and the long-term. An essential part of realising our potential  has been to focus on our core strategies  and take these into the growth opportunities  offered by the global trend to move rapidly  from development into operations. A natural  consequence is a reduction in expenditure  as we cease or scale back activities outside  this focus area. This, in turn, has helped to  increase profitability of Spirent’s operations  and to increase cash generation.
