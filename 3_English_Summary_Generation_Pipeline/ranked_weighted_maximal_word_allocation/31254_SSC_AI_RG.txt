Founded in 2009, Parkwalk is the UK’s leading  university spin-out focused EIS fund manager. We are  delighted to have the team on board and Parkwalk  recorded a net contribution of £1.6m for the period  since acquisition, while co-investing in six IP Group  portfolio companies. Expansion into Australasia IP Group was also delighted to announce a landmark  agreement with Australasia’s leading universities  in 2017, which will see at least A$200m invested  in finding and developing companies involved  in disruptive innovation. The commercialisation  agreements, the first of their type in Australasia,  were signed with nine universities: the University of  Adelaide, Australian National University, the University  of Melbourne, Monash University, UNSW Sydney, the  University of Queensland, the University of Sydney  and the University of Western Australia in Australia,  and the University of Auckland in New Zealand. The  Group committed to invest at least A$200m over  a 10-year period to fund investments in spin-out  companies based on the intellectual property (IP)  developed by academics at the nine universities,  generated from research in areas such   as digital medicine, new medical therapies and  quantum computing. Key portfolio events Turning to the portfolio, I would draw out a few  highlights. During the year, Diurnal received positive  CHMP opinion for its Alkindi® product, followed by  market authorisation in February 2018, paving the  way for Diurnal to become the first IP Group company  to launch a new therapeutic in Europe, which is  anticipated in Q2 2018. Istesso commenced Phase  2a clinical trials for its lead MBS2320 programme  in Rheumatoid Arthritis and expanded its R&D  collaboration with Janssen. Autifony Therapeutics  Ltd, a Touchstone Innovations company, announced  it had signed a €627.5m collaboration agreement  with Boehringer Ingelheim. And finally, once again,  Oxford Nanopore has shown significant commercial  progress during the period, with the company  recently announcing that 2017 order intake had  increased approximately three-fold to $25.3m, with  an expectation for a similar level of growth in 2018,  and a number of product developments, including the  launch of the GridION x5.  In addition, our portfolio companies continue  to attract significant external funding, raising  approximately £315m of new capital this year.  Significant fund raisings included AIM-quoted Tissue  Regenix Group plc (£40m), Actual Experience  plc (£17.5m) and, among the private companies,  Ultrahaptics Ltd (£17.9m) and Creavo Medical  Technologies (£13.4m). MAY 2017 OCTOBER 2017 IPG announced the result of £181m (net)   capital raising with new
