Enthusiastic We make things happen: we are Chairman’s statement Good progress  has been  made against  our Vision  2020 strategy I am honoured and delighted to be the  newly appointed Chairman of Kier. Group revenue 1, 2  for the year ended 30 June 2017 increased by  5% to £4.27bn (2016: £4.08bn) and underlying operating profit 1   increased by 3% to £146m (2016: £141m). Underlying profit  before tax 1 at £126m (2016: £116m) represented a 8% increase.  Reported profit before tax of £26m (2016: a loss of £35m)  includes non-underlying items, predominantly relating to the  disposal of Mouchel Consulting and the portfolio simplification  programme. The underlying basic earnings per share 1  from  continuing operations of 106.8 pence (2016: 99.5 pence) has  increased by 7%. The Group’s net debt 4  at 30 June 2017 was  £110m (2016: £99m), at the lower end of expectations,  following strong working capital management during the year.  This performance has maintained a net debt to EBITDA ratio of  less than 1x, in line with our Vision 2020 target. After the year end, the Group completed its acquisition of  McNicholas Limited, which strengthens the Group’s presence in  the utilities and infrastructure services market. This acquisition  builds on Kier’s strategy to maintain its leading positions in  chosen markets. It is a highly complementary addition to our  current utilities business and enhances our presence in the power,  rail and telecoms markets. Dividend The Board is recommending a full year dividend for the year ended Chief Executive’s strategic review We have  strengthened  our positions  in our core  markets In 2017, we made good progress  operating in our core markets: building,  infrastructure and housing. The two-year  portfolio simplification programme has  enabled the Group to strengthen its  market-leading positions, laying robust  foundations which improve our efficiency  and provide a platform for growth. How would you summarise Kier’s performance  in 2017? From a strategic perspective, 2017 was a good year for  Kier. We continued to simplify and streamline the Group,  which enabled us to focus on our key clients and chosen  markets and position ourselves for the future. Operationally, our  core businesses continued to grow their market positions,  especially the building and highways businesses. Financially, 2017 also confirmed the strength of our underlying  business. We saw organic growth in revenue and operating profit  across the Group, and achieved a net debt position which was at  the lower end of market forecasts. At year end, our Construction  and Services order book was approximately £9.5bn including the  McNicholas order book, which secures around 90% of our work for  2018. Our Residential housing business performed well, and our  Property division pipeline expanded to around £1.4bn, which  will provide excellent development opportunities over the next  ten years.  Overall, our performance in 2017 provided further validation of our  core market verticals – building, infrastructure and housing – we  have chosen to pursue.
