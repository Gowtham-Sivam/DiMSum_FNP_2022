We  have expanded our European footprint and client offering  further across attractive markets where the Group targets  leadership positions. When viewed alongside our diversified  investment portfolio and expanding asset management  business, it has been another excellent year of growth and  financial performance. Strong financial performance Total revenue grew 35.2% to £319.0 million (2016: £235.9 million),  driven by core collections 19.7% higher at £342.2 million  (2016: £286.0 million). Profit after tax increased by 51.7% to  £39.9 million (2016: £26.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA increased  10.2% to £230.6 million (2016: £209.2 million). We continue to  see an increase in the contribution from the capital-light asset  management business, with revenues increasing by 53.5% year  on year; our aim is to continue to grow this business over the  medium-term, both organically and via acquisitions. Strong performance across the business enabled us to deliver a  significant increase in underlying profit after tax, up 24.1% to  £56.6 million (2016: £45.6 million), and underlying return on  equity (ROE) now stands at 32.9% (2016: 29.1%).

The business  has a track record of strong cash generation and this  enables us to deliver excellent returns to shareholders,  while simultaneously investing for future growth. As a result,  the full-year dividend, including the proposed final dividend  of 8.1p, will increase to 11.3p, representing an increase of 24.2%  and a 35.0% payout ratio – the top of our guided range.
