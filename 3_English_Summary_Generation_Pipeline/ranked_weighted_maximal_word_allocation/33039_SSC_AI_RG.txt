Sir Anthony Greener stepped down as Deputy Chairman and from the Board on 30 September 2006 after six years and I would like to thank him for his very signiﬁcant contribution to the development of our strategy. His successor is Maarten van den Bergh, who has been a non-executive director since September 2000. Maarten, who prior to his retirement was president of the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company, also chairs the Remuneration Committee and is our senior independent director. And I’d like to welcome two new directors, Deborah Lathen and Franc ¸ois Barrault. Deborah, who is president of Washington-based Lathen Consulting, joined the Board as a non-executive director in February 2007. She brings strong US business and policy experience to BT, including as a previous chief of the Cable Services Bureau at the US Federal Communications Commission. Franc ¸ois joined the Board on 24 April 2007 as Chief Executive BT Global Services (in which role he succeeds Andy Green who became CEO of Group Strategy and Operations). As President of BT International, Franc ¸ois established a record of exceptional growth in BT’s operations outside the UK. ................................................................................................................................................

DELIVERING OUR PLAN I would like to thank shareholders and customers 6 BT Group plc Annual Report & Form 20-F KEEPING BT AHEAD OF THE GAME BT is barely recognisable as the company it was ﬁve years ago. Five years ago, we were primarily a UK lines and calls business; today we are offering communications possibilities that no one had even thought of back then to customers in 170 countries. Possibilities that really do enable them to lead fuller lives and run more proﬁtable, innovative businesses. In a very short time, we’ve gone from a narrowband, ﬁxed-line communications business, to a broadband company harnessing the power of modern networks to help our customers communicate anywhere, any time, using whatever devices they happen to choose. We’ve brought levels of choice and control to our customers at home, at work, or out and about, that would once have seemed impossible. ................................................................................................................................................ Helping some of the world’s largest companies and organisations serve their customers around the world ................................................................................................................................................ Who would have thought ﬁve years ago that BT would be offering next-generation digital TV over broadband? Our BT Vision service enables customers to watch what they want when they want – without having to pay a monthly subscription. Who would have thought that our customers would have been beneﬁting from intelligent, seamless ﬁxed/mobile communications – like BT Fusion – at home, at work or in between – chatting, swapping data, surﬁng the internet, doing business? Who would have thought that we would be helping some of the world’s largest companies and organisations do business and serve their customers around the world? Who would have thought that geography would be history and time irrelevant? But the thing about transformation, however radical and however successful, is that there is no end point. No moment at which you can sit back and think ‘job done’. Even when we hit ﬁve million broadband connections in 2005 – more than a year ahead of schedule – there was no time to take it easy. Today, that number is around 11 million and climbing. Our broadband success sums up the type of company BT is becoming. A company that goes the extra mile, that rallies behind its goals, that ﬁnds
