WHAT WE DO Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can  generate power within 30 seconds of  being switched on remotely – provide  a vital, low cost solution to assist in  balancing the UK’s energy supply on a  moment by moment basis.  Since the introduction of intermittent,  renewable power to the UK’s energy  mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity  is retired, the National Grid has faced  increasing risks of brownouts and  blackouts. UK power prices have seen  recent peaks above £1,500 per MW  hour due to outage and generation  imbalances; there is therefore a need  for a reliable source of power that can  be accessed quickly and flexibly during  periods when demand exceeds available  supply.  HOW WE OPERATE Our facilities use established, reliable  technology based on containerised  generators, fired with renewable green  fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified  Natural Gas (LNG). Nine green fuel projects have been  financed with a combination of debt and  £35m of equity by Rockpool Investments  LLP in individual companies established  for this purpose. Plutus PowerGen has a  44.5% stake in each company, and earns  fees of £150,000 per site per year from  management contracts.  Other facilities, which will be gas- powered, will be held in dedicated  subsidiary companies as part of a non- dilutive investment model in which we  will seek to obtain a majority interest. We  maintain complete flexibility in financing  options for both the equity portion and  the asset finance and maintain dialogue  with many providers of finance. During  the year we received an offer from a ‘Big  Six’ multinational utility company to fund  up to 20% of our flexible energy projects.  Indeed, we have also just announced  Heads of Terms agreement with JCB  Power Products Broadcrown Limited,  a part of the JCB Group, to provide,  install, maintain and finance generators  for existing and future projects, which  may be through JCB Finance Limited or  asset finance, where appropriate. JCB  Finance Limited is part of the Royal Bank  of Scotland Group plc. Our model is built upon the ability to  earn revenue from multiple markets for  flexible power, as well as from secured  management contracts read more on  pages 14 to 17: • Short Term Operating Reserve (STOR) • Firm Frequency Response (FFR) • Triad • Merchant power sales • Capacity Market – on 15 year  contracts Finally, we have begun to develop battery  projects through our partnership with  London & Devonshire Trust (LDT), which  represents c.80MW in our pipeline. WHERE WE OPERATE The projects in our pipeline are located in  various regions of the UK. Our first site, in  Plymouth, has traded successfully since  it began operations in November 2016; required by the solar farms,  and would therefore allow  greater utilisation of the  connections. By providing  an additional return to the  solar farm operators, we  would help to accelerate  the development of solar  farms without the need for  subsidy. Battery Sites These will generally be  stand-alone but may be  used in conjunction with  Gas or SolarFlex and  our stand-alone battery  projects are currently being  developed in partnership  with LDT. OUR PIPELINE We have a total pipeline of over 700MW, and will have 120MW of capacity in operation for this  winter with a further 140MW at the post-planning stage by the end of 2017. We aim to develop the following types of projects, and are actively working with a company  to explore ‘front-ending’ each site using exhaustible (i.e. non-firm) power from batteries or  capacitors to allow us to compete in additional balancing markets as well as be more price  competitive in existing markets: Green Fuel 100mw Green Fuel 60mw Gas 80mw Gas 700mw Green Fuel 20mw OPERATIONAL COMMISSIONED BY  YEAR END 2017 PERMITTED IN PLANNING   FOR NEXT CM PIPELINE 03 OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PLUTUS POWERGEN PLC  ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Investment Proposition FAVOURABLE  MARKET DRIVERS   On-going structural changes in UK energy supply  continue to drive demand for flexible power generation  as the proportion of energy generated from intermittent  renewable sources continues to grow.
