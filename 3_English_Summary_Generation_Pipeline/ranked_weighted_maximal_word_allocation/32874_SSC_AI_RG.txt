Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 We expected 2017 to be the toughest  year to date for Lamprell. It was.  Unfortunately, in addition to the revenue  pressures anticipated by the broader  industry, we encountered major  operational challenges on the East  Anglia One project which resulted in  a significant loss for the Group and  negatively impacted our financial  statements accordingly . The Group’s  operational and financial performance in  2017 fell well short of our expectations  even though we made good progress  in delivering our strategic goals. Clear strategy It is critical to preserve the long-term  perspective amid immediate challenges,  and 2017 has been a year of change and  strategic repositioning for Lamprell. Our  immediate priority was the operational  demands of our ongoing projects. In  a global energy environment marked  by complexity and uncertainty, the  Board focused on developing a clear  strategy with solid deliverables to  ensure Lamprell’s future. Despite initial  indications of a recovery in the oil & gas  industry, we do not expect the new build  jackup rig sector to recover in the near to  mid-term as capital expenditure amongst  oil producers remains restrained and new  project awards continue to slip 04.  We therefore are determined to access  alternative markets, in particular in the  renewables sector , and broaden our  service offering by participating in larger  and higher value EPC(I) contracts through  partnership options.    Another pillar of our strategic vision is  gaining access to resilient markets and  in particular Saudi Arabia. In spite of  being one of the most influential regional  players in the Middle East with a 40+ year  track record in fabrication, Lamprell has  not previously done business with Saudi  Aramco, one of the most significant global  oil majors. This finally changed in 2017  and we are delighted to have entered  into a joint venture agreement with the  company along with Bahri and Hyundai  Heavy Industries to build a new maritime  facility in eastern Saudi Arabia, which  will become one of the largest yards in  the world 12. For a company of our  size, this is a critical point of entry into a  dynamic market committed to ongoing  growth and a major stepping stone  towards our strategic goals.  Our investment will enable Lamprell to  build on 18 As the downturn in the oil industry continues to affect our traditional  sources of revenue, in 2017 we struggled to execute on our entry  into the renewable foundations market. This is a major new market for  Lamprell which presents both significant opportunities and challenges. CONFRONTING  CHALLENGES,   LEARNING FOR   THE FUTURE   2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 114.8 359.0 407.0 1,400.0 739.8 Total awards   (USD million) Lamprell plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 19 towards the end of the project, we would  have made a profit in line with our return  expectations. This gives me confidence  that going forward we can compete  successfully in this important and fast- growing sector . Our rig refurbishment segment continues  to demonstrate solid performance, and   we noted a recovery in new orders  towards the end of the year , although   the scope of work requested remains  below historical norms.  In other segments, we reported  successful completion of a mid-size  project for Schlumberger comprising of  two land rigs of their new design. The  client is deploying them for operation in  the region. This project has reinforced  our emerging reputation for constructing  high-quality land rigs in a safe and timely  manner , and we will be looking to build on  this in the coming years. Implementing the strategic objectives During 2017, the Group successfully  implemented a number of steps towards  fulfilment of its strategy as it looked to  diversify and de-risk its exposure to oil  price volatility and to access revenue  generating opportunities in new sectors  and geographies.   Our most ambitious step in the journey  of transformation was the joint venture in  May 2017 to establish a major maritime  yard in Saudi Arabia see 11. This  was the culmination of many months  of negotiation and due diligence, and  so it was pleasing not only to sign the  agreement with the partners, but also  to see such overwhelming support  from our shareholders for the project.  When fully operational, the yard will  provide Lamprell with an unprecedented  opportunity to access a major growth  market. Construction works have  already commenced, and we expect full  commissioning of all zones by 2022.
