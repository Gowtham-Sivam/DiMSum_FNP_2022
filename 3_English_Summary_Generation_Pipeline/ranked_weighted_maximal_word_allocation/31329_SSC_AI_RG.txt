 Chairman� s statement Overview Following the sale of our Adult Services  business to Cygnet Health Care Limited  (Cygnet), a wholly owned subsidiary of the  US company Universal Health Services, Inc.  at the end of 2016, Cambian became a pure  children’s specialist education and behavioural  health services business, offering a full range  of essential services from therapeutic fostering  through to specialist schools and residential  care. As at the end of 2017, we managed  222 facilities and employed over 4,500 staff,  looking after 1,920 children and young people. 2017 has been a year of transition as we  established our platform to achieve modest  growth and become the leading provider in  children’s services. As part of the conditions  of the sale of our Adult Services business to  Cygnet, we undertook to support these activities  through a transitional services agreement  (TSA) on commercial terms with Cygnet, which  required significant management and staff  resources until the TSA completed at the end of  June. We were not therefore able to right size  all our cost base until the second half of last  year. However, since then we have undertaken  a significant cost-cutting exercise. This will result  in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions  on an annualised basis, half of which have  been reflected in 2017. We have also spent 2017 repositioning the  business towards a differentiated integrated  recovery model incorporating care, education  and therapy for children with the highest needs,  which is where we believe there is a significant  shortage of care and education facilities.  This transformation has led us to review all  of our facilities and where appropriate we  have closed certain facilities that cannot be  re-positioned cost-effectively . We have largely  completed this process with one facility likely to  be closed or sold in 2018. This transformation  has also led us to review the strength of our  management team and its ability to deliver  more acute services, as a result of which  we have made a number of senior hires,  comprising Head of Special Educational Needs,  Head of Fostering, Director of Quality and  Director of People. We are confident that we  now have the right senior management team  to successfully manage and grow the business. Our focus during the year has been to fill  existing capacity, increase fee levels from  higher acuity services and reduce the cost  base to increase margins. Good progress has  been made on increasing average fee levels  and average occupancy levels have been  maintained whilst re-positioning services.

Anoop’s most recent role was  as Group Financial Controller at Kier Group plc,  having previously held senior positions in the  construction industry . Martin Hopcroft, who  joined the Group in late 2015, stepped down  as Chief Financial Officer on this date. We now  have a strong triumvirate running the business  with Saleem Asaria as CEO, Anne Marie Carrie  as COO and Anoop Kang as CFO. At the conclusion of the Company’s Annual  General Meeting on 5 June 2017, both Alison  Halsey , Chair of the Audit Committee, and  Chris Brinsmead, Senior Independent Director  and Chair of the Remuneration Committee,  stepped down from the Chief Executive’s strategic review Cambian Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 14 Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%,  to £18.7 million (2016: £16.2 million) with  adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.5% (2016:  8.9%) reflecting the growth in revenue as  well as cost savings made in our head  office functions. These positives were offset  by one-off impacts resulting from the sale of  the Adult Services business and a provision  made for changes to legislation regarding  staff “sleep-ins” at our facilities. Operating profit before exceptional   items was £2.4 million (2016: £0.2 million  loss) with a statutory operating loss of   £8.8 million (2016: £7.6 million loss). The  loss from discontinued operations following  the sale of the Adult Services business was   £3.6 million (2016: £155.0 million profit). Average occupancy was broadly level  at 1,286 places (2016: 1,294) with an  underlying transition towards higher severity  cases during the year. Average utilisation  increased to 78% (2016: 74%) following a  planned reduction in operational capacity   to 1,643 (2016: 1,744). Average occupancy in the fostering division  was 634 (2016: 645) with 649 placements   at the end of the year.  Creating a strong Children’s   Services platform The completion of the TSA allowed us to  focus on reducing our central costs to align  our business with its new scale and focus  on Children’s Services with an efficient  overhead structure. We reduced our cost  base in the second half of the year and are  continuing to identify further operational  efficiencies that will be delivered during  2018 and 2019. During the period, I am pleased to report  that we have significantly strengthened  our management team to ensure we  are able to execute on our strategy. Our  key appointments include the following  experienced leaders: • Anoop Kang, formerly at Kier Group and  Balfour Beatty, joined us as CFO. • Rob Walker, previously at Mencap, joined  us as People Director. • Dr Sharon Menghini, formerly Director of  Children’s Services at a number of local
