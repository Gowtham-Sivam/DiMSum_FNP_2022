 *Restated  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  3 1.0 Strategic Review At a Glance Background EKF Diagnostics is a global medical diagnostics business with a long history in point-of-care testing  and manufacturing reagents for use in central laboratories. Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in Germany,  have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working  in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine. The POC business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a  regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. In 2017 we sold an estimated  70 million tests. This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a  percentage of organic growth each year. The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured  at premises near San Antonio, Texas. Clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel  systems or on EKF’s own brand of analysers.  EKF Life Sciences, based in Elkhart, Indiana, manufactures diagnostic enzymes and contracted  custom products for use in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and industry. 2017 Sales Geographical Performance  Cardiff, UK Shanghai, China Barleben, Germany San Antonio, TX Elkhart, IN Moscow, Russia Tests  sold 2017 70,217,529 2016  69,371,019 Analysers  sold 2017 14,556 2016  13,649 +7% +1m Revenue FY 2017 (£k) FY 2016 (£k) +/- (£k) APAC 4,210 3,930 +280 EMEA 17,005 15,558 +1,447 AMERICAS 20,369 19,101 +1,268 Americas (£k) FY 2017 £20,369 EMEA (£k) FY 2017 £17,005 APAC (£k) FY 2017 £4,210 Leipzig, Germany 4 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Point-of-Care: Hemoglobin Analysers Product Portfolio The hemoglobin analysers product range within EKF Diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues  and the size of of diabetes 8 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Chairman’s Statement I am delighted to present results which show  continued good progress with revenues,  earnings, and net cash all significantly improved  compared with the previous year.  Strategy The Group has continued to follow the path  which led to the successful turnaround of  the business in 2016, namely concentrating  its activities on point-of-care diagnostics  and the related central laboratory reagents  business, while reducing costs and simplifying  the business. In the first half, we closed our  manufacturing site in Poland and transferred  activities to our main European hub in Barleben,  Germany. This led to a small number of  redundancies, and we thank those affected and  wish them well for the future. As a result, the  number of sites used by the Group has reduced  from a peak of twelve to seven, of which four  are in Europe, two in the USA and one in China.  While we are not currently planning further  closures, our efforts to improve efficiency and  therefore reduce costs continue. After considerable deliberation and discussion  with our professional advisors, we were unable  to proceed with our plan to split out the central  laboratory business in a tax efficient manner. sTNFR venture Subsequent to the year end, on 11 January  2018 the Group announced its intention to  spin-out its sTNFR biomarker technology into  a separate entity, Renalytix AI, Inc., which has  been registered in the USA. sTNFR1/2 (Soluble  Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptors 1 and  2) are novel biomarkers used in combination  with artificial intelligence to identify which  diabetes patients are at the highest risk of  progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD)  potentially leading to End Stage Renal Disease  (ESRD). Plans for the entity are at an early stage  and discussions with partners are continuing.  Capital changes 14 March 2018  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc | Annual Report 2017  9 1.0 Strategic Review Chief Executive’s Review It is pleasing to be able to report a strong set  of results for 2017. In particular, cash generation  has once again been very strong, with net cash  growing from £2.2m to £7.0m during the year,  despite spending £1.4m on capital expenditure  and £1.5m on the cancellation of share options. Operations We have succeeded in our aim for 2017 of  driving the existing business and continuing  to reduce cost. Gross margins have improved  at a greater rate than the increase in sales.   We have sold around 15,000 analysers and 70  million tests during the year and cemented  our place as number one supplier of Beta  Hydroxybutyrate ( β-HB) reagent in the USA,  and number two worldwide in Hemoglobin  point-of-care products. During the year we completed the restructuring  of our manufacturing operations by closing our  manufacturing facility in Poland. Production  volume was shifted to our factory in Barleben,  Germany and customers successfully  transitioned away from the older style cuvette  previously made in Poland. In Barleben we have  invested in modern production equipment  including new automated equipment for  the manufacture and packaging of the Quo- Test cartridge. At our Elkhart facility, where  we manufacture a number of wet chemistry  products, we have a medium term programme  to update the facilities to improve quality and  volumes. Point-of-Care EKF’s point-of-care business model continues  to be to sell analysers into the market and  then benefit from the ongoing revenue  stream generated by sales of the dedicated  consumables. Over the last five years we have  sold over 65,000 analysers for use worldwide,  and each year we supply a growing number of  tests for use on these.  Hematology Sales of Hematology products have increased  by 10% to £12.9m (2016: £11.7m). Sales of Hemo
