The UK remains one of the leading franchises  across the Domino’s network worldwide,  and our franchisees are rightly considered  to be among the very best anywhere in the  world. Between them, they increased our  UK network by a record 95 outlets and at the  end of 2017 we traded from 1,045 stores  in the UK. We also took the opportunity  to acquire a majority stake in the largest  franchisee in the London area. This will  be a platform for more rapid growth in the  currently under -developed London market,  and for the development of innovation in  technology, pricing and menus. Outside our home market, progress has  been encouraging. In the Republic of Ireland,  we opened our first stores for six years  in response to the strong economic  recovery in that market. We are seeing  an acceleration in growth in Switzerland,  driven by changes to menu pricing and  a very strong online performance.
