Maintaining the substantial improvements made to all UK pension schemes under ownership  Since making its first acquisition in 2005, Melrose has achieved an average annualised return on equity investment of 17%, with an increase in adjusted operating margins of between five and nine percentage points across businesses sold to date. We have also addressed chronic underfunding in pension schemes we have inherited, securing the future for scheme members.  Strategic Report  Shareholder value creation  Responsible stewardship (figures up to 31 December 2022)  £366m  In aggregate, the GKN UK pension schemes are now in surplus helped by £366 million cash contributions made to GKN UK defined benefit pension schemes from the Group so far during Melrose ownership, reducing the funding deficit on acquisition of c.£1 billion, making them now fully funded.  Schemes for current businesses The Melrose funding commitment made on the acquisition of GKN has been fulfilled ahead of time. Ongoing annual payments remain at £30 million and there is no funding requirement from future disposal proceeds or potential demerger activities.
