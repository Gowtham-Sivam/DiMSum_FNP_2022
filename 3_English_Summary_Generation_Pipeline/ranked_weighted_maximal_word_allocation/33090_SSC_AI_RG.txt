The acquisition  of a controlling stake in The Mall and  the subsequent successful tender  for units held by minorities has been  transformational for the Group.  Conversion to a REIT at the end of 2014  which was followed by the sale of its  German portfolio, completed shortly  after the year end, enables the Group to  focus all its resources on its stated aim  to become the UK’s leading community  shopping centre REIT.  The Group is now well positioned to  achieve this objective based on its  exposure to a high quality portfolio of  strong assets, dominant in their immediate  catchment, which offer the potential to  generate significant income and NAV  growth based on a programme of exciting  asset management initiatives across the  portfolio. Performance overview The timing of the Mall acquisition means  that both existing shareholders as well  as those who participated in the £165  million Firm Placing and Placing and  Open Offer have been able to benefit  from the upswing in investment markets  which has gathered momentum as the  year has progressed. The 62.56% stake  was acquired for a consideration of £212  million at a discount of 5% to property  values as at 30 June 2014.

After a number of years in which shopper  numbers have fallen, footfall was up  across the seven shopping centres in  absolute terms (by 0.9%) and continued  to outperform the benchmark (by 1.8%).  This is supported by information from our  indicative C&R trade index which showed  retailers’ sales across our portfolio were  up 2.2% in 2014 compared to a 0.5%  decrease in 2013.  Administrations were sharply lower in  2014 compared to 2013. This has helped  occupancy grow from 95.0% as at   30 December 2013 to 96.1% at the  end of 2014 on a like-for-like basis.  This increased occupancy has led to an  increase in passing rent, particularly in the  second half of the year from £62.8 million  as at 30 June 2014 to
