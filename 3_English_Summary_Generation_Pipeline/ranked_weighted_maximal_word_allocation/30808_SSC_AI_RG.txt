The forthcoming demerger of the Group,  announced in July 2017, reflects both the end  of an era and the start of a new one. The Board  and management team are convinced that   we are on the right strategic path. In fulfilling   our fiduciary duties to you, the Board regularly  examines strategic options. We elected to split  the Group into two independent businesses:  the Bank and an investment vehicle, which   we call Georgia Capital. If we do it right, we could be at the eve of   a major jump in value creation. We will have  created three large groups, all quoted on the  London Stock Exchange, each with their own  Board, management, and strategic logic. It is  an opportunity to deliver better service to our  clients, better development to our employees,  more growth of the corporate sector of the  country, and finally significant financial return   to our shareholders.
