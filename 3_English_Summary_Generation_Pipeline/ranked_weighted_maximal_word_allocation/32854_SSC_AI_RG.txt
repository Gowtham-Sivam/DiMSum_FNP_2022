Susan Kilsby Chairman  5 Shire Annual Report 2017  Strategic report Governance Financial statements Other information Chief Executive Officer’s review The leading global   biotech company   focused on rare diseases 2017 is the year Shire solidified its position  as the global leader in rare diseases.  With approximately 70 percent of revenues  coming from rare disease products, and the  most robust pipeline in Shire’s history —  60 percent of which are biologic therapies  — we continue to make significant progress  in the Company’s evolution. As we evolved, we also put the Company  on solid financial footing. Key to Shire’s  performance has been the ability to achieve  strong financial results while managing  our largest integration. We grew by  approximately 17,000 employees and  consolidated 28 country sites globally —  and remain on track to deliver on our  Baxalta cost synergy goal of $700 million  by the third year post-close. We achieved  6 Shire Annual Report 2017 symptoms of dry eye disease (DED),  reached more than one million prescriptions  written since launch in late 2016. I am  greatly appreciative of what our talented  and focused team has delivered, in many  cases, exceeding our performance  expectations in 2017.  Two distinct market-leading businesses Since I arrived at Shire five years ago,  we have grown from an ADHD-focused  company to a global biotech with two  distinct market-leading businesses — rare  disease and neuroscience. To enable these  two businesses to reach their full potential,  in early 2018 we announced that the  neuroscience business warranted  additional sharpened focus and increased  investment and that there was a strong  strategic rationale for creating separate  Rare Disease and Neuroscience divisions.  For more information about the two  divisions, please see page 12.  Innovation at the heart of our  vision and culture  Our long-term vision is to be an innovation- driven biotech company focused on rare  diseases and specialized conditions across  our core scientific platforms and  therapeutic areas. Shire has an excellent  record of accessing external innovation and  delivering late-stage products to market.  Going forward, we plan to build on these  capabilities by taking our internal research  to a new level. To accelerate this goal,  we have appointed a new Head of  Research and Development and Chief  Scientific Officer, Andreas Busch, PhD, an  accomplished scientist with an extensive  background and impressive track record  in research. At the same time, we continue to  complement our R&D innovation with new  advances in health information technologies  and precision medicine. Shire is utilizing  artificial intelligence (AI) as well as pursuing  wearables and sensor technology,  particularly in clinical trials. We are  partnering with new, cutting-edge  companies to improve the time it takes  for rare disease patients to find a diagnosis,  tailor our treatment options for smaller  patient groups, and help us identify hard  to find patients for clinical
