My predecessor,  Alastair Lyons, who ably steered the ship for  over 16 years, has left some large shoes to  fill. I would like to thank him for his service  and enabling a smooth transition. As Chairman of the Group I will focus my  efforts on:  • Continuing to build on the remarkably  special Admiral culture and in so doing  putting our people and customers at   the heart of what we do • Continuing the history of growth,  profitability and innovation • Investing in the development and   growth of our people • Ensuring excellent governance  and the highest standards. 2017 Overview Admiral Group has delivered another record  set of results in 2017: record turnover and  profit, strong return on capital, strong  solvency ratio and record customer numbers.
