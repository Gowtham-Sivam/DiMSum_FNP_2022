for investors on the Groups performance as described in Note 1. The B&M UK adjusted EBITDA shown above includes an adjusted profit of 1m in FY22 (FY21: loss of (2)m) relating to 
the corporate segment as referred to in Note 2 of the financial statements. The corporate segment also has a further 13m (FY21: (3)m) of adjusting items which are excluded from the 
definition of adjusted EBITDA. For further detail, see Note 3 of the financial statements and the reconciliation on page 21.
