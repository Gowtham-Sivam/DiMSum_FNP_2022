Pennon is committed to providing a  safe place for our people to work where health and  wellbeing comes first. The Board has supported the  appointment of a Group director of Safety, Health,  Quality and Sustainability, who will devise and  implement a strategy to raise the Group’s health  and safety performance. Employees and culture  Throughout the Group, there is a spirit of pride and  professionalism and these are key qualities at a time  of change. We have no shortage of new talent joining  the company too, through graduate recruitment  and our award-winning apprenticeship programmes.  We are determined to recognise talent in both the  Group’s businesses and to support development  of people from early on in their careers, not just in  top-level succession planning.  As many aspects of the Group’s structure are still  relatively new, we intend to provide more information  about Pennon’s culture and values in next year’s  annual report. Our subsidiary companies each have  a strong sense of purpose supported by their own  set of corporate values and this provides a sound The ratio is similar across senior management with  16% female. Of those employed directly by Pennon,  45% are women. We are committed to improving  senior management gender ratios in time across the  Group through initiatives such as informal mentoring  programmes and family friendly policies. A working group is ensuring Pennon complies with  new legislation on gender pay equality that requires  certain companies to publish information on  their gender pay gap and report this data to the  UK Government.  We believe fully  engaged staff  facilitate better  safety, greater  productivity and  higher customer  satisfaction.
