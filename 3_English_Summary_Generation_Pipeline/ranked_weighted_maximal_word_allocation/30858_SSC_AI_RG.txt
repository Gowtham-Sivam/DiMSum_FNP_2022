Our key strengths Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 02 Where we work  03 Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report Introduction Chairman’s statement Return to full statutory profit, doubling of operating margin to 10%,   Annually Recurring Revenue growing, and strong cash generation.   Tribal has maintained its market leadership with significant new customers  gained. Shareholder value is now being created in a sustainable manner. With the Group placed on a sound financial footing in 2016, and  with many of its operational challenges addressed, I am pleased  to report that the Group has now returned to full year statutory  profit for the first time since 2013. Annually Recurring Revenues, which now include cloud services,  grew over 5% to £37 .5m, overall profitability doubled to an  adjusted operating margin of 10%, compared with 5% in 2016,  and the Group ended the year with net cash up 59%, at £14.1m  (2016: £8.8m). Shareholder value is now being created in a  sustainable manner as the Group continues to drive efficiencies  in the business: a further £3m of annualised savings was realised  in 2017 , bringing the total annualised savings realised to £12.0m  since the initiation of the cost savings programme; this has driven  improved financial performance without impacting the Group’s  ability to serve its customers or drive its business forward.  For the year to 31 December 2017, Tribal Group achieved an  adjusted Operating Profit of £8.5m, up 82%, on a revenue  of £84.9m (2016: operating profit of £4.7m on a revenue of  £90.3m) and increased Adjusted Earnings per Share (diluted) to  3.2p (2016: 1.9p). The fall in revenue was adversely impacted by  a combination of the expiry of the Ofsted Early Years contract  in March 2017 and the disposal of Synergy in March 2016  – excluding these factors, the revenue increased by 6.5%,  particularly due to the strong performance in the remaining  Quality Assurance Solutions (QAS) Chief Executive's report Tribal Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 16 In 2017, the Group has continued to build on the strong  foundations built in 2016 and has driven a significant and  sustainable improvement in profitability.  Revenues fell in 2017 to £84.9m (2016: £90.3m); however,  2016 revenue included £11.6m relating to the Ofsted contract  which successfully concluded in March 2017 (2017 Ofsted  revenue: £3.0m), and £1.7m from Synergy (disposed of in March  2016) and SLS (closed 2015). Excluding these items, revenue  relating to continuing operations increased by 6.5%, to £81.9m  (2016: £76.9m).  Annually Recurring Revenues, which from 2017 include cloud  services, increased by 5.5% to £37.5m (2016: £35.5m). We identified areas where we can more effectively align the  Group’s resources to deliver material cost efficiencies and  improve margin without impacting the Group’s ability to serve our  customers or drive our business forward. Cumulative annualised  cost savings achieved since the start of the cost efficiencies  programme total £12.0m, of which £3.0 annualised savings were  realised in 2017 (2016: £9.0m annualised, of which £5.8m in year).  The impact of these actions has grown through the year, and  we can report a significantly improved trading performance for  2017, with the first full year statutory profit since 2013, and  adjusted operating profit up 82% to £8.5m (2016: £4.7m). This,  coupled with good cash generation, with net cash up 59% to  £14.1m (2016: £8.8m), has left the Group in a stronger position  at the end of the financial year. 2017 in summary In our chosen regional markets and sectors, overall activity  levels for the replacement or enhancement of student  management systems have remained stable; we have seen  significantly improved win rates in our UK Further Education  and Work-based Learning businesses and
