Our second priority is to grow our ordinary  dividend in line with earnings through the  cycle. Over the past five years we have  grown our dividend by 6.1% p.a, during a  period of significant reinvestment. During  this period, we have delivered free cash  flow of more than 140% of our dividend,  demonstrating the cash generative nature  of our business model. Reflecting the continued confident  outlook for the medium term, the Board  is proposing a 5% increase to the full year  dividend to 15.85p per share for 2017   (2016: 15.10p per share). With products installed on over 69,000 civil  and military aircraft, increased content on  new aircraft and consistent growth in air  travel, Meggitt is well positioned for growth  over the medium to long term. Having passed the peak of investment  in research and development, the focus  of the business is now on building the  capability and capacity to deliver these new  programmes to our customers and driving  operational efficiencies that will enhance  our competitiveness and accelerate growth  in shareholder returns.
