    "1. Get the sections which have the scores greater than cutoff 0.744291\n",
    "2. Extract the body of sections\n",
    "3. Normalize the scores and adjusted number of words to be picked from the section\n",
    "4. Maximize the word allocation in case some sections doesn't have required word\n",
    "4. Extract top k words\n",
    "5. If no relevant sections -> Write the complete file as summary with top 1000 words\n",
    "6. Compare the system summary with each gold summary and get the rouge score. Take average of all gold summaries for the respective file.\n",

This growth was attributed to both organic expansion and strategic acquisitions. However, the gross profit margin experienced a slight decline from 8.3% to 7.8%, influenced in part by the rise in the minimum wage. Despite this, the division managed to enhance its cash margin per hour. Significant investments were directed towards bolstering the Recruitment division\\'s IT infrastructure and attracting senior talent.

Notably, the Recruitment division expanded its operational footprint with an additional 38 OnSite locations, culminating in a total of 395 locations.\\n\\nOn the PeoplePlus front, a 19% revenue decrease to £114.5 million was attributed to the phasing out of the Work Programme. Despite this revenue decline, prudent cost management initiatives led to an 11% reduction in operating profit. PeoplePlus remained engaged in diverse sectors including justice services, employability, and skills services. The introduction of the Apprenticeship Levy created fresh avenues for apprenticeship delivery, leading to the acquisition of new contracts.
