Mears Group focuses on long-term outcomes and positive social, economic, and environmental impact across its two divisions, Housing and Care. The company carries out 6,000 repairs daily in homes across the UK and has made excellent progress in 2017. Mears has broadened its services in affordable housing, with the acquisition of Omega in 2014 unlocking new housing management opportunities. The primary focus remains on organic growth, but further acquisitions may be considered to reinforce market-leading positions. Clients are increasingly seeking partners who can operate strategically and operationally across a range of housing services, and Mears has extended its core reactive and planned maintenance offerings to include housing management for more integrated solutions. The company is involved in regeneration projects, such as in Milton Keynes, and offers services like repairs and maintenance, estate management, asset management, income management, emergency accommodation, and new housing development to various customers, including local authorities, registered social landlords, private landlords, tenants, service users, community groups, and pension funds. In the Care division, Mears provides personal care to over 15,000 elderly and disabled people and has made progress in a challenging period. The company is focused on improving quality and cost over time and combining services into an integrated approach for better user outcomes at lower overall costs. Mears offers a comprehensive range of domiciliary care, complex care services, housing adaptations, and assistive technology to address independent living challenges faced by elderly and disabled individuals. The company is committed to delivering excellent service, maintaining strong financial management, and leading the way in social value through positive community engagement projects and effective measurement.In the Chairman's statement, Bob Holt acknowledges Mears Group's strategic shift towards housing management and Placemaking activities, emphasizing the creation of sustainable communities. He discusses the UK Government's significant commitments to housing and the removal of the rent cap in 2020, which will enhance client confidence. The Chairman highlights the company's evolving focus on housing and care services and its alignment with customer needs. He also mentions the company's dedication to delivering value to clients and its unique strategy for long-term success. Despite a challenging year, Holt is pleased with the operational progress made and believes the Group is well positioned to benefit as core markets continue to develop. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the challenges faced by clients and providing innovative solutions to address them. The Chairman also discusses the Group's strict discipline when bidding for new contract opportunities, remaining highly selective and never changing the bidding model to meet short-term growth aspirations. The Board remains confident in future opportunities and expects to continue following a progressive dividend policy. Holt also highlights the exceptional response rates in the 'Say what you see' survey across the company's 12,000 employees, showing continued improvement from 2016 levels. The Group is looking to appoint an employee director to the Board to ensure full, open, and honest insight from its workforce on strategic initiatives implementation.The Chief Executive's strategy overview highlights the company's dedication to providing exceptional service and value to clients as a key aspect of business management. In 2017, the value of new contracts secured was below expectations due to a reduced level of traditional repairs and maintenance work coming to market and aggressive pricing by competitors. Mears will continue to focus on bidding only at sustainable pricing levels. The strategic shift towards housing management and Placemaking activities is discussed, including the construction of new homes for regeneration and asset management. The company has evolved into a leading housing management business in the UK, addressing the issues resulting from rising levels of homelessness. The CEO emphasizes the importance of understanding the link between housing and care, as almost half of social housing is occupied by a single resident, with a high proportion of people aged 65 or older or disabled individuals requiring care support. The company's capability and awareness of these needs have underpinned its success. The Group will increasingly focus its care bidding activity towards clients where there are likely to be opportunities to provide a complete housing service. Interest from Local Authorities in procuring new care accommodation for supported living and extra care services is seen as a compelling service offering, with three such schemes currently underway and a good pipeline developing. The CEO expresses confidence in the company's future success based on its unique strategy and commitment to understanding and meeting client needs.
