Cloudcall Group plc reported a 42% increase in revenues to £6.9m in 2017, with recurring revenues up 55% compared to the previous year. The company's gross margin improved to 80%, and its EBITDA loss (excluding share-based payments) was reduced to £1.9m. Cloudcall raised £5.7m in new equity during the year and had £4.9m in cash at year-end. The number of users increased by 45% to 23,520, and the average customer size grew by 24% to 27 users. The company's relationship with Bullhorn has been strengthened, offering further growth opportunities following Bullhorn's acquisitions of Connexys, Talentrover, and Jobscience. Cloudcall also launched a new unified communications architecture for Bullhorn customers and a new Microsoft Dynamics CRM integration built on this architecture. Instant Messaging/SMS functionality is expected to launch in Q2 2018.The Chairman's Statement highlights the company's impressive growth rates, which were somewhat constrained by limited cash resources and resource limitations in product development. The year 2017 was described as a year of consolidation and preparation, with the business focusing on strengthening the foundations for future growth. Prior to the fundraise in the autumn, the Group was cash constrained, allowing for limited investment in sales and marketing activity. Growth rates were achieved with minimal outbound marketing and sales staff numbers held at minimum viable levels. This lack of dedicated resources held back the rate of new customer acquisition, particularly in the US. The additional funds raised are now allowing the company to expand its sales and marketing functions. Resource limitations were also felt in product development, where a significant portion of software development resources was focused on rebuilding the core infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform. This exercise restricted the ability to launch new revenue-impacting products and services in 2017. The new platform architecture is designed to improve consistency, lower maintenance overheads, allow for faster deployment of new functionality, and increase the ease and speed of new integrations with additional CRMs. The updated solution also significantly improves the user interface and provides a more intuitive user journey. Development work on building SMS and instant messaging services has been progressing well, with a scheduled release in May 2018. The company anticipates an increase in revenues from both existing customers and improving new customer signup rates. The relationship with Bullhorn has continued to strengthen, with its staff's knowledge of and confidence in the CloudCall service noticeably improved when it selected the company as its own telecoms provider.In the Chief Executive's review, CloudCall Group's strong relationship with Bullhorn is highlighted as a significant opportunity for the company, especially following Bullhorn's acquisitions of Talentrover, Jobscience, and Connexys. These acquisitions have increased CloudCall's addressable market and repositioned their penetration of Bullhorn's total EMEA users to 14%. The review also emphasizes the company's decision to focus more heavily on the recruitment and staffing sector, which employs over 12 million people globally, before exploring other markets. CloudCall's integrated communications products are a strong fit for this sector, helping firms increase their speed in contacting candidates. The company's staff numbers have increased from 89 to 119, reflecting their desire to capitalize on the market opportunity. The review also highlights the company's commitment to creating a caring and inclusive culture, investing in staff mentoring, training, and support mechanisms, as well as charity and community initiatives. The outlook for the company is positive, with growth in recurring revenue and strong trading in line with expectations.
