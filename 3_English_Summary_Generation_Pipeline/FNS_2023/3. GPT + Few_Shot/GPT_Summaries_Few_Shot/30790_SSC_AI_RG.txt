This growth was fueled by the creation of deep, mutually beneficial relationships with business partners through the traditional B2B2C model and strategic investment in key markets. The company's European businesses maintained strong retention performance, positioning it well for growth in 2018. CPPGroup works with partners to deliver bespoke, innovative prevention, protection, and assistance products and services, providing end-to-end management of these services. The company's strategic framework focuses on deepening relationships with business partners, investing in growth markets, realigning mature markets, driving innovation, and expanding internationally. The first of these market entries will be Bangladesh in mid-2018, managed through the successful Indian business hub. The company will also operate a decentralized model that provides greater responsibility and accountability for local leaders and enables efficient delivery of services and products that meet local needs. Overall, the CEO expresses confidence in the business's international expansion and growth prospects.The Chairman of CPPGroup Plc emphasizes the company's significant progress in 2017, with year-on-year revenue growth for the first time since 2011. The strategic priorities identified in 2016 have been successfully executed, resulting in increased customer numbers and revenue growth. The UK market remains an important component of the global business, and the technical expertise of Blink is being utilized to develop innovative product solutions, such as the recent launch of Owl in Turkey. The company will continue to seek product extensions to its portfolio, as demonstrated by the investment in a minority shareholding in KYND Limited, a business focused on cyber security monitoring and diagnostics for large and SME businesses. The Chairman also highlights the importance of culture and values, with the Board approving significant investment in developing an open, honest, and authentic culture throughout the business. Two new Directors, Oliver Laird and Tim Elliott, have joined the Board, contributing significantly to the Group. The Board remains committed to maintaining high standards of governance, both at a corporate level and operationally throughout the business, with a focus on retaining clear oversight and a 'flat' organization structure.

The CEO discusses the company's approach to cost control, organizational change, and international expansion strategy, emphasizing the importance of building strong relationships with business partners and customers. The statement also highlights the crucial role of colleagues in driving the business's growth strategy and expresses optimism about the company's direction and progress. The CEO notes that while the Group's profit before tax has increased compared to 2016, underlying operating profit is lower due to a shift in revenue mix from high-margin back book products in the UK and Spain to primarily India, where strong trading performance comes from lower-margin products. The planned change to the segmental reporting structure is expected to provide stakeholders with a clearer analysis of the Group's progress over time. The Board has approved the Annual Report & Accounts as fair, balanced, and understandable, providing the necessary information for shareholders to assess the company's performance, business model, and strategy. Looking ahead, the business is well placed to continue its growth in 2018 and beyond, with a simplified operating structure, lower cost base, and increased available cash following the release of regulatory restrictions and the sale of the York premises. The company sees potential for substantial growth in China and plans to incorporate CPP Bangladesh in 2018, initially providing significant support through the extension of the successful Indian business model. The CEO thanks all colleagues for their continued commitment, hard work, and support during the year and looks forward to working with them as the company continues to rebuild its business.
