Inmarsat's 2017 Annual Report highlights the company's financial performance, with revenues of $1,400.2m, profit after tax of $182.3m, adjusted EBITDA of $751.4m, and cash CAPEX of $598.7m. The company operates in four core business units: Maritime, Government, Aviation, and Enterprise. The Maritime unit, which accounts for 45% of group revenue, offers reliable and resilient communication solutions to the maritime industry, focusing on vessel performance, efficiency, safety management, and crew welfare. The Government unit, accounting for 29% of group revenue, provides mission-critical voice, video, and data communication solutions to governments worldwide, ensuring security, public safety, and remote service delivery. The Aviation unit, representing 15% of group revenue, provides connectivity services to both the cockpit and cabin, ensuring safe and secure communications between the cockpit and air traffic control. Lastly, the Enterprise unit, accounting for 11% of group revenue, offers a wide portfolio of global voice, broadband data, Machine2Machine (M2M), and value-added services, with growth opportunities in emerging Internet of Things (IoT) markets such as mining, smart cities, smart agriculture, logistics, and transportation.Inmarsat's unrivaled portfolio includes the Global Xpress (GX) network, which is based on four Inmarsat-5 satellites and provides a global, mobile, high bandwidth network. The European Aviation Network (EAN) is an integrated S-band satellite and air-to-ground network that offers higher capacity, wider coverage, faster speeds, and lower latency for commercial aviation customers in Europe. Inmarsat's L-band networks, supported by eight Inmarsat-3 and Inmarsat-4 satellites, have established a loyal customer and distribution base. The Inmarsat-6 satellites, which are dual payload (L-band and Ka-band) satellites, will be launched at the start of the next decade to reorient L-band capabilities towards new growth opportunities. Inmarsat's geostationary satellites provide global coverage, with 99.9% L-band satellite and ground network availability meeting the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) standards. The life cycle of a satellite involves planning and concept, design development, manufacture and testing, launch, and in-orbit testing, with a projected operational lifespan of 15-20 years.Inmarsat's 2017 annual report highlights the company's belief in the expansion of broadband connectivity in markets with little or no terrestrial wired or wireless connectivity, such as at sea, in the air, and in remote environments. This investment thesis supports Inmarsat's purpose of 'enabling a connected world' and positions the company as a leader in this global opportunity. Inmarsat expects increased demand for connectivity from consumers on aircraft, ship owners, mariners, and government and aid workers in remote environments. The company's resources are focused on investments that ride this trend. In 2017, Inmarsat's solid operational progress supported the Group in delivering revenue growth of over 5% for the year, with their investment in Global Xpress, a high bandwidth global mobile satellite network, starting to show material returns, generating over $140m of revenue in the year. The company also successfully launched their fourth GX satellite in May 2017, to provide global in-orbit redundancy and additional capacity and capabilities into new regional growth opportunities.Inmarsat's Chief Executive's strategic review highlights the company's focus on capturing significant growth opportunities in the coming years, driven by the increasing demand for global mobile satellite broadband services and the potential of satellite connectivity services for emerging IoT applications. The company underwent major organizational changes in 2017, including a headcount reduction program and changes to the Executive Management team. These developments, along with investments in network infrastructure, are expected to position Inmarsat well for future growth. The company's strategy is based on capturing the maximum number of broadband platforms, re-positioning L-band services for new growth, establishing a digital platform and business, creating a high-performance organization, and transforming the operating environment. Inmarsat expects to achieve mid-single digit percentage revenue growth (excluding Ligado) over the next five years, with improvements in EBITDA and free cash flow generation.
