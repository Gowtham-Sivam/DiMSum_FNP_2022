Tyman's product offerings include hardware (45%), sealing (17%), balances (11%), operators (9%), speciality access products (9%), polymer extrusion (4%), industrial and restoration (4%), and metal forming (1%). The company mainly sells to manufacturers of doors and windows (73%), distributors and wholesalers (19%), and other industrial uses (8%). Tyman operates through three divisions: AmesburyTruth in North America, which manufactures window and door hardware components, extrusions, and sealing systems; ERA in the UK and Ireland, which designs, develops, manufactures, and distributes solutions for the residential building and home improvement markets; and SchlegelGiesse, which comprises the Group's businesses outside North America and the UK sealing and extrusion businesses. In 2017, Tyman reported revenues of £332.7m, £80.3m, and £109.7m for AmesburyTruth, ERA, and SchlegelGiesse divisions, respectively.In his first statement as Chairman of Tyman, Martin Towers highlights the company's solid results for 2017, with profitable growth assisted by increased contributions from the Bilco and Giesse businesses acquired in 2016 and further margin expansion in the enlarged SchlegelGiesse business. Despite facing challenges such as operational issues in Juarez, Mexico, short-term market share loss in AmesburyTruth, and subdued market conditions in the UK, Tyman demonstrated resilience. The Board focused on four key areas in 2017: how the Board operates, succession planning, Group strategy, and health and safety. An externally facilitated evaluation of the Board's operation confirmed its open and collegiate culture while providing direction for future improvement. Succession planning saw several changes to the Board composition and roles, including the appointment of Helen Clatworthy and Pamela Bingham as Independent Non-executive Directors. The Group's strategy remains to be a leading international supplier of engineered components to the door and window industry, with a focus on operational excellence, targeted acquisitions, and close alignment with customers. Investments were made in new facilities in Statesville, North Carolina, and Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and the small acquisition of Howe Green was completed. However, the number of lost time incidents and severity rates increased across all three Divisions, prompting further investments in health and safety measures and a determination to improve the Group's record in this area. The Board is recommending a final dividend of 7.75 pence per share, making a total of 11.25 pence per share for the year, an increase of 7.1% over the previous year.Tyman plc's Chief Executive Officer, Louis Eperjesi, reported a profitable growth for the Group in 2017, with increased contributions from the Bilco and Giesse acquisitions and favorable exchange rates. The Group's footprint projects in each of the Divisions progressed well, resulting in safe, modern, and flexible facilities to support customer needs, increase product quality, and improve service levels. Reported Revenue and Underlying Operating Profit increased by 14.2% and 10.0% respectively, mainly due to the acquisitions and favorable exchange rates. On a constant currency like-for-like basis, Revenue increased by 1.7% and Underlying Operating Profit decreased by 1.5%. Cash generation was lower than in recent years due to targeted investment in working capital and continued investment in the balance sheet. The Group remains cash generative and Leverage at the year-end of 1.83x was comfortably back within the Group's core year-end target range of 1.50x to 2.00x. ROCE decreased slightly in the year to 13.6%, with the Group continuing to target achieving a ROCE of 15.0% over the medium term. Tyman's key priorities for 2018 include improving health and safety, completing moves into new facilities in the UK and US, encouraging effective communication and sharing of best practices across Divisions, achieving like-for-like Revenue growth and margin expansion, continuing self-help initiatives, pursuing an active acquisition program, and completing the integration of Bilco and Ashland Hardware into AmesburyTruth. The outlook for 2018 is positive, with expectations of further profitable growth.
