The company has made progress in its three strategic priorities: building a more balanced business, instilling a more commercial culture, and driving an innovation agenda. These initiatives have helped restore sales growth and mitigate Â£26m of inflationary cost headwinds faced in the past year. The company achieved like-for-like sales growth of 1.8% in the financial year, consistently outperforming the market. However, adjusted operating profit was down 3.1% due to inflationary cost pressures. To build a more balanced business, the company has focused on optimizing the balance of brands across the estate, increasing the premium aspect of the business through the growth of Miller & Carter, and enhancing the amenity of other formats through remodel programs. To instill a more commercial culture, the company has improved guest focus, online reputation, and identified efficiency and cost-saving opportunities. To drive an innovation agenda, the company has made progress in its digital strategy, focusing on technology that impacts each aspect of the guest journey. Despite the uncertain economic and political environment, the company believes that success in the evolving market requires quality brands, great experiences, and high amenity levels to generate sufficient sales growth to mitigate cost headwinds.
