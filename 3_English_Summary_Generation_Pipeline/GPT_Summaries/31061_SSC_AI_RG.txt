LoopUp Group's Chief Executive Officers, Steve Flavell and Michael Hughes, reported strong and efficient growth during the financial year 2017, with a 33.5% increase in revenue on a constant currency basis. The company's gross margin improved by 220 basis points to 76.7%, and profitability developed further with LoopUp EBITDA growing by 161% to £3.5m and diluted EPS growing by 722% to 4.4 pence. The performance was driven by the company's differentiated competitive positioning and efficient 'Pods' organizational structure for new business acquisition. A recent survey commissioned by LoopUp showed that 68% of enterprise conference callers still use dial-in calls with phone numbers and access codes, despite the frustrations and security concerns associated with this method. LoopUp's contrarian approach focuses on providing a minimalist interface and reliable, high-quality experience for remote meetings, resulting in users foregoing dial-in 75% of the time. The company's Pods have continued to operate efficiently, delivering an average of £472,000 of new annual recurring revenue at an average fully-loaded non-recurring cost of £483,000. LoopUp's customer base remains well diversified, with the largest single customer representing just 3.6% of total revenue. The company's strategic priorities for 2018 include continued investment in Pods, product development, and growing the existing customer base. The outlook remains positive, with strong demand for LoopUp's product and confidence in the ability to deliver further growth.In the Chairman's Statement, Lady Barbara Judge CBE highlights LoopUp's strong performance and consistent growth, as well as its continued product innovation. She emphasizes the company's ability to address the significant problem of inefficient and frustrating conference calls, offering an innovative alternative that has been well-received by enterprises. LoopUp's differentiated product and organizational strategy contribute to an exciting outlook, with the company well-positioned to grow in line with market expectations and deliver on strategic priorities. The statement also notes LoopUp's commitment to high standards of corporate governance, applying aspects of the UK Corporate Governance Code as appropriate for the business. Lady Barbara Judge expresses her confidence in the management team and Board, and looks forward to the AGM on 15 June 2018.
