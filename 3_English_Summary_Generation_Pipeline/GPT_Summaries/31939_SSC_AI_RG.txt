The Chief Executive's review highlights the company's growth and success in the industry.Eagle Eye Solutions Group has reported significant strategic and operational progress in 2017, with revenues exceeding expectations and increasing by 71%. The company's growth strategy has focused on winning new customers, increasing transactions from existing customers, and deepening customer relationships. In June 2017, the company raised net proceeds of £5.8m through a placing of new equity, which will be used to accelerate investments in product development, infrastructure, and marketing resources to drive international expansion.

The partnership with TCC supports Eagle Eye's move into the European market, providing greater international reach. The company is also exploring strategic alliances and partnerships to expedite its win ratio or extend its reach in the value chain. In 2017, Eagle Eye experienced increased demand from all sectors, resulting in significant new customer wins, such as John Lewis. The momentum is expected to continue, with revenue for the first quarter of the financial year ending 30 June 2018 expected to be at least 32% up on the prior year comparative period at approximately £3.0m. Transaction volumes are expected to be in the region of 30.0m, representing growth of 157%.

The company's strategy focuses on three core areas of customer interaction: Win (bringing more customers onto the Eagle Eye AIR platform), Transact (driving higher redemption volumes through the platform), and Deepen (building relationships with customers as the breadth of the product portfolio becomes more developed). Eagle Eye has added new retailers and brands to the AIR platform, increasing the number of live users to 233, including 74 FMCG brands. Redemption volumes have grown by 58% year-on-year to 60.4 million, driven by the full-year benefit of Asda volumes, the first phase roll-out for Sainsbury's, and increased brand activity through redemption outlets. The company has also formed strategic partnerships with TCC, a world leader in creating retail marketing programs and long-term loyalty schemes, and Driftrock, a life cycle social advertising company, to extend its digital promotions offer into the European loyalty market and enable the success rate of advertising on social media channels to be measured through to redemption.
