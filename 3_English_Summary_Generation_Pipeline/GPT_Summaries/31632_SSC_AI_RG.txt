The company's net property income increased by 5.0% to £88.3 million, thanks to continued demand for space in popular locations and a proven management strategy.

Limited opportunities to buy the type of buildings Shaftesbury owns and strong investor demand have led to a reduction in investment yields in the West End market. The company's unique portfolio in London's West End focuses on restaurants, leisure, and retail, which have a long record of resilience and growth. The West End's broad economic base and global appeal provide a degree of protection against national economic headwinds, as evidenced by Shaftesbury's strong performance through different business cycles and operating environments in its 31-year history. The company is confident that its strategy will continue to grow its exceptional portfolio's income and value, delivering returns to shareholders.
