Sareum, a specialist drug discovery and development company, has made significant progress in its pipeline, particularly with the licensing of SRA737 to Sierra Oncology. This agreement has the potential to provide substantial funds for Sareum to advance and broaden its pipeline programs, validating its business model and drug R&D expertise. Sareum focuses on developing targeted small molecule therapeutics for cancer and autoimmune diseases, generating value by licensing them to international pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies at the preclinical or early clinical trials stage. In 2017, Sierra Oncology reported initial progress of the two ongoing Phase 1 trials of SRA737 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), and patents protecting SRA737 were granted in the USA and Europe. Sareum received £1.5 million from the US$7 million upfront payment on signing the SRA737 license agreement with Sierra Oncology, and later received a £450k share of the US$2 million success milestone payment. Additionally, Sareum received Aurora+FLT3 patent grant notifications for China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, and successfully concluded a BioMedical Catalyst funded feasibility study for TYK2, with lead compounds showing tumor regression in a disease model of T-ALL.Sareum Holdings' 2017 annual report highlights the company's progress in its drug development pipeline, focusing on cancer and autoimmune diseases. Sareum operates a collaborative and outsourced business model, conducting laboratory-based research through collaborators and third-party providers. The company's pipeline includes SRA737, a Chk1 kinase inhibitor targeting genetically defined solid cancers, which is in two Phase 1 clinical trials. Sareum also has a co-development agreement with SRI International for TYK2 kinase inhibitors, targeting autoimmune diseases and cancer. The company's Aurora+FLT3 kinase program targets AML and other blood cancers, with a lead candidate in preclinical development. Sareum's business model and expertise in drug design and early-stage development have been validated by a licensing agreement with Sierra Oncology, resulting in a maiden profit for the company.Sareum Holdings' Annual Report and Accounts 2017 highlights the important clinical progress of SRA737, a novel Chk1 kinase inhibitor. SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1, a key regulator of cell cycle checkpoints and central mediator of the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 in two innovative Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and tumors with genetic mutations that are thought to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. The first trial aims to evaluate SRA737 as a monotherapy in patients with a defined genetic profile, while the second trial explores the potentiating effects of low-dose gemcitabine in combination with SRA737 in patients with genetically profiled cancers. Sierra Oncology plans to provide an update on the SRA737 program in late February 2018 and expects to present data at a medical conference in H2 2018. Additionally, Sierra Oncology is evaluating SRA737 in combination with targeted cancer therapeutics, such as anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies and other DDR inhibitors like PARP inhibitors, with potential clinical opportunities in 2018.
