The company's history and strengths in digital marketing continue to support the business, with increasing use of data to enhance product selection, website, and marketing. The research use-only product catalogue revenues grew to Â£202.5m, a 27.4% increase over the previous year, with primary antibody revenue growing ahead of the global market growth rate. Product quality remains a major focus, with investments in validation and antibody production technology. Non-primary antibody revenues grew 16% across several product categories, with kits and assays being the largest sub-category. The company is also working to grow custom products and services by partnering with leading diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. The end market value of antibody and immunoassay use in diagnostics and therapeutics is expected to grow to around $80bn by 2022, with Abcam addressing up to $5bn of that total. The company's strategic priorities include sustaining antibody and digital marketing leadership, expanding in related growth markets, investing in operating capabilities, sustaining attractive economics, and supplementing organic growth through acquisitions and partnerships.
