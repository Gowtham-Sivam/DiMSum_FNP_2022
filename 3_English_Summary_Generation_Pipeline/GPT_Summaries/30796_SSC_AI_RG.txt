The company's strategic review four years ago led to the development of six Group strategic themes, which include increasing direct sales effectiveness, developing the knowledge and skills of sales and service teams, broadening global presence, leveraging R&D investments, optimizing supply chain effectiveness, and operating sustainably. In 2017, notable progress was made in implementing these strategic priorities, contributing to strong financial results and organic growth. The company expanded its geographical reach, made significant acquisitions, launched new products, and reduced global carbon emissions intensity by 4%. Both Gestra and Chromalox acquisitions were accretive to Group earnings in 2017 and positively received by customers and employees. The integration of both businesses into the Group has proceeded positively and remains in line with the integration plans reported at the time of their respective acquisitions. As a socially responsible business, Spirax-Sarco Engineering aims to deliver long-term sustainable value for all stakeholders, investing in employee development, product innovation, geographical expansion, community engagement, and environmental responsibility.In 2017, Spirax-Sarco Engineering achieved record revenue and operating profit, driven by a combination of organic growth, accretive acquisitions, and favorable currency movements. The Group reported a 32% increase in revenue to £998.7 million, with 5% organic revenue growth in the Steam Specialties division and 10% organic revenue growth in Watson-Marlow. Adjusted operating profit rose by 30% to £235.5 million, with a 23.6% operating margin. The acquisitions of Gestra and Chromalox, along with the full-year effects of the 2016 acquisitions of Hiter and Aflex, contributed £154.8 million to sales. The Steam Specialties division saw organic sales growth of 5%, while Watson-Marlow achieved 10% organic growth. Group adjusted operating profit was 6% ahead of the previous year on an organic basis, with a 30% increase at reported exchange rates. The adjusted operating margin of 23.6% was 20 basis points lower than the prior year, due to the dilutionary impacts of recent acquisitions. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points to 24.7%, despite increased investments for growth and a rise in material prices.
