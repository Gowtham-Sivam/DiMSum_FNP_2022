Rank Group's purpose is to excite and entertain customers and communities through its multi-channel gaming operations. The company aims to be the UK's leading multi-channel gaming operator, creating value for shareholders, offering strong brands that meet customer needs, and delivering operational excellence in venues and digital channels. Rank Group's performance over the last five years has shown growth in revenue, operating profit, EBITDA, adjusted profit before tax, and adjusted earnings per share. The company has also managed to reduce its net debt significantly. Rank Group excites and entertains through customer relationships, technology, innovation, and venues. The company's brands include Grosvenor Casinos, which has introduced 'full' and 'partial' open door policies in its venues, resulting in a change in the way total Group customer numbers are calculated. Rank Group's results are presented in both adjusted and statutory formats, with the directors believing that exceptional items and adjustments impair the visibility of the underlying performance of the Group's businesses. Therefore, non-GAAP measures of revenue, profit before tax, EBITDA, operating profit, and adjusted earnings per share are used in internal reports.Rank Group's Chairman, Ian Burke, highlights the company's strong financial position, market-leading brands, and clear strategy for long-term growth in his letter. He emphasizes Rank's commitment to responsible gambling, detailing the steps taken to increase the scale and impact of their response to problem gambling, including the formation of a board responsible gambling committee, development of propensity models, investment in a responsible gambling team, and the creation of a Customer Solutions Hub in Sheffield. The letter also mentions management team changes, such as Alan Morgan joining as managing director of Mecca's retail business and David Balls succeeding Sue Waldock as the Group's human resources director. Alex Thursby is welcomed as a non-executive director, while Owen O'Donnell will step down later this year. The board recommends a final dividend of 5.3 pence per share, resulting in a full-year dividend of 7.3 pence per share, a 12% increase from last year. The Group's culture is emphasized through the rollout of its group-wide values, STARS, reflecting the behaviors necessary for Rank employees to achieve the company's strategic goals. The letter concludes with an acknowledgment of Rank's strong financial position, market-leading brands, and clear strategy for long-term growth.The Rank Group's Chief Executive, Henry Birch, highlights the company's priorities for the next 12 months, focusing on five specific areas to drive growth and long-term value. These include launching a single account and wallet product across Grosvenor channels, introducing new digital brands, implementing a clear Grosvenor London strategy, opening further Luda sites, and maintaining disciplined central and above-club costs. Birch also discusses the regulatory outlook for the gambling industry, stating that the sector is awaiting the Department of Media, Culture and Sport's recommendations on the 'Triennial Review'. He believes that the industry will regain lost trust as responsible gambling measures are promoted. In terms of retail growth, Birch emphasizes the importance of focusing on the experiential side of casinos and bingo venues to maximize their potential. He also addresses the potential impact of Brexit on the business, stating that the majority of the company's revenues and costs are in pounds sterling and that they have appropriate contingency plans in place. Finally, Birch discusses the introduction of company-wide values, which have been embedded into business processes and daily working lives.
