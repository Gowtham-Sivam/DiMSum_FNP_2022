Corporate calendar highlightsBelvoir Lettings plc is the UK's largest property franchise group, operating in both the lettings and sales markets with 300 offices across the country. Founded in 1995 as a specialist franchised lettings agent, Belvoir extended its services to estate agency in 2014 and has since adopted a multi-brand strategy by acquiring Newton Fallowell, Goodchilds, and Northwood franchise networks. The group now manages a portfolio of 58,020 properties and has a total revenue of £11.3m. In 2017, Belvoir acquired Brook, a specialist mortgage broker, to provide customers with mortgage and property-related financial services products. The company's proven multi-brand franchise model, award-winning services, recurring revenue stream, experienced leadership team, and highly trained staff make it an attractive investment option. Belvoir aims to grow further through the acquisition of additional significant franchise networks or companies offering specialist property-related services.Belvoir Group has reported significant progress in 2017, with profitability increasing by over 60% and total revenue reaching £11.3m. This growth was driven by increases in both Management Service Fees (MSF) from lettings and sales, as well as acquisitions and increased property sales by the Belvoir and Northwood networks. The company's franchisees have adapted well to new regulations and pursued new revenue streams, such as property sales and financial services. In 2017, Belvoir acquired Brook, a financial services company, to maximize returns from individual property transactions through the sale of specialist mortgage and property-related financial services. The company aims to extend its share of the UK property market by leveraging its expertise as a franchisor and consolidating the sector. The Board is also committed to broadening the range of property services offered by its franchisees. Belvoir's senior management team has been instrumental in doubling the number and value of transactions under the Assisted Acquisitions program, successfully integrating the Northwood network, and starting the process of cross-selling financial services to the whole Group through Brook. The company's revenue increased by 14% to £11.3m, operating profit increased by 56% to £3.9m, profit before tax increased by 62% to £3.9m, and adjusted earnings per share improved by 28% to 11.3p. The company has increased its dividend to 6.9p per share, showing confidence in its growth strategy.Belvoir Lettings plc's CEO Dorian Gonsalves discusses the impact of online estate agencies, Brexit, and the upcoming ban on tenancy fees on the traditional estate and lettings agency business. He believes that online agents have lowered the public's expectation of fees for estate agency services, but this has not negatively impacted Belvoir's business. Gonsalves sees no discernible impact from Brexit on the property market, as property transactions remained stable in 2017 due to supply and demand and access to relatively cheap mortgage lending. He does not think the ban on tenancy fees is the right solution to make renting more secure for tenants, as it will likely increase the cost of renting for many. Gonsalves expects the size of the private rented sector (PRS) to increase in the next ten years, and increased regulation around property letting and licensing will encourage private landlords to use a lettings agent. He predicts that the number of lettings agencies will reduce by 20% in the next three years, which presents a significant opportunity for Belvoir's network. The company's growth strategy includes an Assisted Acquisitions programme, which has enabled 44 franchised businesses to grow their businesses and increase their market share by acquiring their competition.
