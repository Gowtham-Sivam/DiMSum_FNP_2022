WideCells Group is now focused on growth and the commercial roll-out of products and services across all three divisions, as well as exploring opportunities in the Asia-Pacific territories, where the stem cell industry is gaining increasing profile.WideCells Group PLC's Chief Executive Officer, João Andrade, highlights the increasing recognition of stem cell therapy's life-saving potential in a wide range of medical applications, with 82 illnesses currently treatable using stem cell procedures. As more people become aware of the benefits of storing stem cells, the industry is experiencing additional development and advancement. WideCells Group has successfully launched its first-of-its-kind end-to-end stem cell service, covering storage, insurance, research, and education/training, and is now focused on achieving global roll-out to build revenues and ensure access to stem cell treatment for all people, regardless of geography or financial position. The company is focused on cord blood as the most useful and best quality source of stem cells, with over 250,000 samples being stored per annum and growing fast. However, many people do not realize that treatment costs could climb to as high as £300,000, making it unaffordable for many. To address these limitations and strong growth dynamics, WideCells Group has created its end-to-end stem cell service, including the highly innovative CellPlan product, the first global stem cell insurance package. CellPlan is live in the UK and has strategic agreements in place to launch in Spain, Brazil, Thailand, India, and Singapore in the coming year. WideCells Group has also launched its own stem cell storage services at the Institute of Stem Cell Technology in Manchester, UK, following landmark licensing approval from the Human Application Licence in February 2018. The company's BabyCells service offers umbilical cord blood and tissue storage services to clients in the UK and Europe, with clients also offered one year's stem cell insurance cover provided by CellPlan. WideCells Group's final offering is education and training-focused services, delivered through a bespoke online platform called Wideacademy, which launched the first stage in February 2018. Led by the former Director of Apple Education, Alan Greenberg, Wideacademy is committed to utilizing the power of education to support stem cell uptake across all levels of the industry. Looking ahead, 2018 is set to be incredibly active for WideCells Group, with a primary focus on driving product uptake to deliver strong recurring revenues and realize meaningful value for investors, while providing clients with an affordable and quality product offering that provides life-saving medical cover for them and their families. The company will continue to target strategic opportunities that provide value uplift opportunity, but the first and foremost focus is on building the profile and global reach of its innovative stem cell services.
