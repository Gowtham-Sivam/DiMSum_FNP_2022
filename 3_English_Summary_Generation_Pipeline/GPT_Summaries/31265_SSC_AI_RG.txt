Significant progress has been made in rolling out its platform and technology, which is expected to pave the way for revenue growth in 2018 and beyond. The Group delivered its single biggest campaign in the last quarter of 2017 for Tangeche, a major China-based car leasing firm, embedding brand images and messages in over 200 episodes of video content over a five-month period. Momentum has continued into the new year with the signing of two landmark contracts with Univision and NBCU in the North American market and renewing an important contract with Youku/Alibaba in the Chinese market. The Group's focus on people has led to an increase in the number of employees from 74 to 91, with staff now in place to serve partners in China (Shanghai), Brazil (São Paulo), India (Mumbai), the United States (New York), and Europe (London). The development of Marketplace, a transactional tool, and the potential to demonstrate the impact of in-video advertising to broadcasters and digital distributors, gives the Group confidence in its ability to drive significant growth in the coming year and beyond.In the Chief Executive's statement, Mark Sabin Tadeusz Popkiewicz highlights the tremendous marketing power of in-video advertising, emphasizing the company's progress in 2017 with a focus on maturing technology.
