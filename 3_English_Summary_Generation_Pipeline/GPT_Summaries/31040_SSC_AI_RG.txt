The company's Residential Systems segment saw a 10.3% increase in revenue to £223.5m, driven by strong demand in the new housebuild sector. However, the Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) market remained slow due to weak consumer confidence and falling real wages. The Commercial and Infrastructure Systems segment saw a 2.0% increase in revenue to £188.2m, with UK revenue accounting for 79% of the overall segment revenue. The company faced challenges in the Middle East due to a trade embargo between Qatar and many Gulf states, leading to the closure of their Dubai manufacturing facility and a non-underlying charge of £4.0m. Polypipe continues to invest in new product technology, automation, and recycling initiatives, consuming approximately 44,000 tonnes of recycled material in 2017.
