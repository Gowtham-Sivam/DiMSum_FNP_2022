Hargreaves Lansdown's Chairman, Mike Evans, reports a successful year for the company, with record levels of net new business and profits, despite the challenges posed by the EU referendum result and market volatility. The company responded positively to these challenges, resulting in £6.9 billion of net new business for the full year. Assets under administration (AUA) reached nearly £80 billion as of 30 June 2017, and profit before tax grew by 21% to £265.8 million. The company has undergone a transition to new executive leadership, with Chris Hill replacing Ian Gorham as CEO and Philip Johnson joining as CFO. Evans also announced his intention to stand down as Chairman once a suitable replacement is found. The company has revised its remuneration policy in response to external debates and shareholder concerns, and has declared a final dividend of 20.4p per share, resulting in a total ordinary dividend of 29.0 pence per share for the year, an increase of 20% over 2016. However, due to the Financial Conduct Authority's reassessment of the company's regulatory capital requirements, Hargreaves Lansdown will not pay a special dividend for the financial year ended 30 June 2017.Hargreaves Lansdown aims to be the best place for savers and investors in the UK, with a strong culture focused on clients.

Hargreaves Lansdown's proprietary technology allows for nimble and efficient service, and its multi-channel marketing approach ensures clients have high-quality information to make informed decisions.Hargreaves Lansdown CEO Chris Hill is proud to lead a business that puts clients at the heart of its operations. The company is a market leader, managing the wealth of nearly a million individuals. In 2017, Hargreaves Lansdown broadened its offering, adding products such as the Lifetime ISA and two new HL Select funds, launching new mobile apps, increasing its digital marketing presence, and growing its execution-only stockbroking market share. The company added a record net new business (NNB) of £6.9 billion, introduced 118,000 net new active clients, and grew its active client base by 14% to 954,000. Brexit impacted investor confidence and NNB in the first part of the year, but the company still increased its market share and grew assets faster than the UK D2C platform market. In the second half of the year, improved investor confidence, selected fund launches, increased ISA allowance, and targeted transfer campaigns saw NNB accelerate. Assets Under Administration (AUA) increased 28% to £79.2 billion, driving revenue growth of 18% and increasing profit before tax by 21% to £265.8 million. The company continually looks to enhance its offerings, developing two equity funds and launching the Lifetime ISA. Hargreaves Lansdown is excited about the potential of Active Savings, its upcoming cash management service, and is targeting a live proposition ready to launch around the end of the year. The company has seen a significant increase in client activity this year and continues to invest in resources to maintain client satisfaction. Expanding its digital footprint is a key strategic drive, with 138.4 million digital visits for the year to June 2017 (up 31% on last year). The launch of the new mobile app in February has been well received, with over 486,000 downloads and £72 million added to the Vantage platform. As the new CEO, Hill's challenge is to drive the next phase of Hargreaves Lansdown's growth, with a vision to be a household name and the best place for savers and investors in the UK. This means investment in people, marketing, and technology as the company continues to grow and add clients.
