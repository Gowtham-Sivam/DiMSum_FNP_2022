The businesses target stable “GDP plus” underlying revenue growth over the business cycle with sustainable attractive margins and then convert the profit into strong free cash flow by tightly managing working capital and focused capital investments. The free cash flow generated then funds healthy growing dividends and selective value-enhancing acquisitions which accelerate growth in revenues and profit to double-digit levels. The strategy consistently delivers a return in excess of 20% pre-tax on total capital invested and steadily increasing shareholder value. In 2017, the Group delivered strong double-digit growth in revenue and earnings with robust underlying growth, a modest net contribution from acquisitions, and further benefiting from the strong tailwind from the depreciation in UK sterling. Over the last three years, a total of ca. £90m has been invested in acquisitions which contributed ca. 16% of 2017 Group revenues. During 2017, total acquisition spend was ca. £20m, of which ca. £15m was invested in the acquisition of Abacus, a long-established supplier of diagnostics instrumentation and consumables to the Pathology and Life Sciences sectors in Australia and New Zealand.
