The company made significant investments in 2017 to maintain, update, and de-risk its solutions and services in light of the increasing regulatory landscape. The integration of OSMO, acquired in April 2017, was largely completed and considered a successful transition. The company is well placed to exploit opportunities arising from the digitalisation of tax compliance and compliance more generally. The Annual General Meeting of the company will be held on 20 June 2018. The company achieved year-on-year revenue growth of 17% and contracted annuity base growth of 12% through 114 new annuity licenses added and average order value growth of 9%. Customer retention remained strong at a rate of 95%, in line with management's expectations. The company completed the acquisition of OSMO in April 2017, valuing it at £3.2 million.In the Chief Executive Officer's Review, Gavin Lyons reports that Tax Systems delivered against all key strategic objectives in 2017, with revenue growth of 17% and debt reduction of 16%. The company's acquisition of OSMO, a leading provider of automated data extraction services, has been successful, with the final stage of integration expected to be completed by the end of H1 2018. Although two potential acquisition targets were declined after due diligence, Tax Systems continues to actively evaluate other opportunities that will enhance the company's offering and shareholder value. Net debt was reduced by 16% to £20.5m, and operational excellence has been a key focus, with significant progress made in implementing a target operating model. Looking forward, the company will continue to focus on executing its strategy to deliver against its goals and vision, with confidence in its technology platform and the dedication of its employees.
