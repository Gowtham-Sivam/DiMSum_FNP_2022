Genedrive has submitted its proprietary Hepatitis C (HCV) test for CE marking and has made positive progress with the US Department of Defense (DoD) biohazard identifier programme. The company has also successfully completed field trials of its Genedrive aquaculture testing programme in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas). However, there has been disappointing uptake of the MTB/RIF assay in India due to sample preparation problems and commercial issues. Genedrive has changed its name from Epistem Holdings Plc and raised £6m from a July 2016 placing, with a strategic focus on molecular diagnostics business opportunities. Financial highlights include obtaining CE marking for the Genedrive HCV ID kit, entering into a distribution agreement with Sysmex Europe for the kit in the EMEA region, and entering the next stage of the US DoD biohazard programme, worth approximately $1.4m in development income and a further $0.5m in product sales. The company has also received a £0.6m conditional grant offer from Innovate UK to fund a centrifuge-free plasma separation device. Genedrive's turnover has increased by 13.7% to £5.8m, with strong growth in development income to £2.6m, driven by the US DoD biohazard programme, and a moderate increase in service income to £3.2m. The trading loss has improved to £4.9m, despite increased research and development and administrative costs, and the cash balance at 30 June 2017 was £5.1m, up from £1.1m in 2016.Genedrive plc Chairman, Dr. Ian Gilham, reports that the company has made significant progress in 2016/17, focusing on the opportunities offered by the Genedrive diagnostics platform in the growing market for decentralized, near-patient diagnostic tests. A major achievement was the development of the Genedrive HCV ID Kit, which was submitted for CE registration in April 2017 and received CE marking post year end. The company also entered into a distribution agreement with Sysmex Europe to target the commercial HCV opportunity in Africa, with an initial focus on multiple countries in the region. The pathogen detection program with the US Department of Defense contributed significantly to the current year revenues, and following successful evaluations, the program will be entering its next phase, worth $1.4m in development income and $0.5m in product sales. The company encountered a sample preparation problem with the MTB/RIF test, and is considering how best to address the Indian MTB/RIF market and the broader potential of Genedrive in this area. The company also validated Genedrive's potential as a rapid cost-effective system for disease detection in animals through funded field trials for white-spot disease detection in farmed shrimp. The Services division continued to contribute to the Group with modest investment, and the Board is focused on ensuring strong governance and values throughout the Company.Genedrive plc has made significant progress in transitioning to a commercial stage diagnostics business, focusing on disease detection built around the Genedrive platform. The company's revenue for the period was £5.8m, a 13.7% increase from the previous year, driven by the Diagnostics division's revenue growth of 36.8% to £2.6m. The Genedrive HCV ID kit, which obtained its CE registration in September 2017, is now ready for commercialization efforts, with a distribution agreement signed with Sysmex Europe for the EMEA region, initially focusing on Africa. The company is also working on refining and simplifying the HCV test to make it more suitable for point-of-need testing and maximize its commercial potential. Challenges remain in the commercialization of the MTB test in India, but the company is considering how best to address the market and the broader potential of Genedrive MTB/RIF. The collaboration with the Department of Defense (DoD) has seen continued success, validating Genedrive as a flexible and accurate diagnostics device and helping to fund important developments. The company is now entering a defining period, with the CE marked Genedrive HCV ID kit positioning it as the first to market with an affordable and cost-effective HCV test. The Board is encouraged by the growing momentum in the business and the outlook for genedrive plc.
