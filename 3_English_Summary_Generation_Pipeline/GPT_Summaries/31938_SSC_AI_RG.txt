Arqiva, the leading independent telecom towers operator and sole terrestrial broadcast network provider in the UK, has experienced strong growth in revenues, earnings, and cash flow in 2017. The company covers 98.5% of the UK population with its Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) platform and has around 1,500 transmission sites, including 90 sites rolled out under its Digital Audio Broadcast (DAB) programs. Arqiva also owns two of the three main national commercial multiplexes and has access to 32 satellites and five teleports. The company has completed 3,537 4G upgrades for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) during the year and has sold 285,256 smart meters in 2017. Arqiva's key activities in executing its strategy include strengthening its position as the UK's leading independent telecoms sites provider, developing the UK's DTT platform capacity, extending DAB coverage, driving new radio revenues, building value in the Internet of Things (IoT) business, and establishing itself as the predominant UK provider of indoor Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) and small cells. The company has enjoyed successive years of revenue and earnings growth, with reported revenue growth for the year of 6.7% and 9.4% organic growth.Arqiva Group Limited reported revenues of £943.8m in 2017, up from £884.7m in 2016, with growth driven by Telecoms & M2M and Terrestrial Broadcast, which saw revenues increase by 18.5% and 6.3% respectively. A significant portion of this growth came from recurring revenues from core telecoms towers business, DTT platform and radio contracts, and the Group's smart metering network. Additional revenue was generated by customer improvement programs, 4G equipment upgrades, and meter sales in relation to the smart water metering contract with Thames Water. Satellite and Media also benefited from new HD channel sales, a new agreement with Al Jazeera Media Network for global teleport distribution services, and foreign exchange gains. Arqiva's contracted order book of £5.7 billion, inflation-linked pricing, and the opportunity to increase infrastructure utilization places the company in a strong position to continue delivering stable profitable growth. The company's ongoing investment in digital broadcast infrastructure, 4G, 5G, in-building solutions, and small cells demonstrates Arqiva's commitment to supporting the UK's ambition for a vibrant and globally competitive economy. Arqiva's transformation program, 'FutureFit', is lowering the company's cost base, streamlining processes, modernizing systems, and improving customer service and operational delivery. The company has successfully delivered large-scale projects leveraging its tower infrastructure, including smart energy and water metering. The smart energy metering contract for the North of England went live during the year, bringing new recurring revenue streams into the M2M business. The rollout of the network is currently at 92% coverage, with the rate of rollout to consumers' homes expected to accelerate over the next 12 months following service user testing. Thames Water has decided to accelerate its network deployment following the successful delivery and results of the smart water metering contract, aiming to achieve coverage of 3 million homes several years earlier than originally planned. Arqiva is progressing with the DAB rollout program for the BBC and has completed upgrades to the analogue radio network as part of the BBC New Radio Agreement. The company is also completing the final sites of the current phase of its commercial local DAB program, meeting the government's target of 90% coverage during this financial year. Arqiva is responsible for a wide range of services required as part of the 700MHz clearance program, including spectrum planning, network design, program management, infrastructure changes, service continuity, asset replacement, and retuning of broadcast transmitters. Within the Satellite and Media business unit, technology improvements have been implemented to increase transponder capacity on existing transponders and exit certain low-margin contracts. UKDTH has achieved growth of HD channels. The company is well placed to benefit from emerging market opportunities, such as 5G, and is confident that its strategy and the support of its people will continue to deliver its objectives and enable growth.
