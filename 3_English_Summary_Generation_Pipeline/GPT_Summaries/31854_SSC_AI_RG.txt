In the Chairman's Statement, Peter Baker, Non-Executive Chairman of Finsbury Food Group, highlights the company's progress towards becoming a leading specialty bakery group in the UK. Despite challenges in the economic environment and changing consumer dynamics, the company has delivered a resilient performance with no need for a radical change in direction. The Group's revenue for the 52 weeks was £314.3m, up 0.3% on a like-for-like basis, and profit before tax at £13.0m is up from £11.8m in the prior period. The company continues to invest in strategic projects, such as a new cake line in Cardiff and a new IT system, to improve overall productivity and offset increases in the cost base. Finsbury Food Group also plans to invest in new plant, equipment, and systems for sustainable and environmentally-responsible manufacturing. The licensing of brands, development of foodservice channels, and business acquisitions are part of the company's strategy for continued growth. The total dividend for the year is 3.0p per share, up 7% from last year's dividend of 2.8p per share.Finsbury Food Group's Chief Executive, John Duffy, reports that the company has become one of the largest specialty bakery groups in the UK, with a small but fast-growing European business. The Group has focused on creating strong foundations and a competitive cost base since 2009, driving efficiency and scale through various initiatives. Despite challenges posed by sustained Sterling devaluation and high input costs in FY 2017, the Group demonstrated solid performance and trading resilience, with growth in both sales and profit. The strong cash flow and robust balance sheet allowed for debt reduction, dividend increase, and continued investment in the business. Finsbury's goal is to maintain pricing for consumers and remain a low-cost producer for customers, which has been achieved through record capital investment of £12.5m in FY17. This investment has gone towards improving overall productivity, offsetting increases in the Group's cost base, and strengthening growth capacity, product capability, efficiency, and cost competitiveness. The Group has also focused on redesigning business processes to drive scale and efficiency, as well as investing in a 'people' strategy to nurture talent and improve employee engagement. Finsbury's consistent strategy for uncertain times involves producing a broad range of high-quality products for growing channels and market niches, delivering growth and differentiation for major customers, and fulfilling end-consumer requirements. The Group has explored acquisition opportunities, but valuations have remained unrealistic given known market headwinds. More challenging market conditions may provide new acquisition opportunities in the year ahead, and the Group remains patient while focusing on strengthening and optimizing current businesses. John Duffy thanks the Board, Executive teams, and colleagues for their continued commitment and hard work, expressing confidence in Finsbury's ability to deliver growth and value for employees, customers, and shareholders in the years ahead.
