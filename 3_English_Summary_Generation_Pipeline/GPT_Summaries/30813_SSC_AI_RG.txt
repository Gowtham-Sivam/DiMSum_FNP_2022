The company operates stores almost entirely through franchisee partners, manufacturing dough and acting as a wholesaler of other food and non-food supplies. They invest in technology to develop the ordering platform, making it easy for customers and improving franchisees' operations, and they market the brand and plan national promotions. Franchisees open and run stores, earning a return from the margin they make on making and selling pizza. They employ, train, and develop their own teams, set prices locally, and invest in local marketing. In other markets, Domino's mainly runs the stores themselves, looking to franchise out stores in most markets as they achieve greater scale and profitability through a larger network. Profitability and returns can be further enhanced over time through investment in dough manufacturing capacity and their supply chain.
