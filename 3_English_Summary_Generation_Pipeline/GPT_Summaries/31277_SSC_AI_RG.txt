Velocys has identified the market for renewable fuels in the United States as a particularly attractive opportunity for the commercialization of its technology, following the company's 2016 strategy review. This large and rapidly growing market is Velocys' immediate focus, with the aim of creating sustainable growth. The global fuel market urgently needs more renewable fuels, as many governments have mandated the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions through the use of cleaner, renewable fuels. The US jet fuel market is around 20 billion gallons per year, with the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) expecting an increase in global air travel by over 3% per year in the coming years. The airline industry has committed to carbon-neutral growth by 2020 and a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050. To meet these targets, a significant increase in the supply of renewable jet fuel is needed. By 2022, there is expected to be a worldwide demand of more than two billion gallons per year of renewable jet fuel based on carbon-neutral growth, with over 700 million gallons per year required in North America. Additionally, the US diesel consumption is around 40 billion gallons per year, with a 25% growth predicted by the EIA to 2040, indicating an urgent and increasing demand for renewable fuels.
