The company sees significant growth prospects in the coming years, with the potential to deliver growth in both the student accommodation and build-to-rent markets.Watkin Jones' Chairman, Grenville Turner, expressed confidence in the Group's financial and operational performance, as well as its strategic progress. The Board and management remained stable throughout the year, with the first formal appraisal of the Board's performance taking place in late 2017. The Group's success was attributed to the strong leadership of Executive Directors Mark Watkin Jones and Phil Byrom. A long-term incentive plan is proposed for FY18 to retain senior staff and reward performance. Mark Watkin Jones announced his intention to step down as CEO, with the Board initiating a formal search for his successor. The Board aims to retain Mark's expertise, possibly through a Non-Executive Director role. The outlook for the Group remains positive, with the development pipeline providing excellent visibility of revenues and earnings. Brexit is not expected to significantly impact the Group, as EU students make up only 7% of the market. The greatest growth potential is seen in the build-to-rent sector, with the Group laying the foundations for a second major business in the coming years.During the year, Watkin Jones plc focused on investing in and empowering their operational Board and management teams throughout the Group. This included helping employees understand their contribution to the business and showing them opportunities within the Group, making the company an employer of choice. They also began succession planning for management at Board level and below, and worked on enhancing performance management and improving communication to drive engagement and collaboration across divisions. The company aims to be economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable, with robust policies governing their work and a focus on understanding and managing the needs of their stakeholders. Additionally, they have been advised that the Curlew Student Trust, launched in 2013 and backed by clients of CBRE Global Investment Partners, is in legal negotiations to sell a portfolio of its assets, with the sale expected to exchange and complete in the next few weeks.
