Bowleven plc is an Africa-focused oil and gas company with strategic interests in key hydrocarbon licenses in Cameroon. The company holds a 25% interest in the offshore, shallow water Etinde permit and a 100% interest in the onshore Bomono permit. Bowleven's vision is to deliver transformational shareholder value through the monetization of its discovered hydrocarbons, focusing on creating value from its assets and managing risk. The company operates in the West African state of Cameroon, which has an established hydrocarbon industry and a history of oil production from the Rio del Rey Basin. The Etinde permit, awarded an Exploitation Authorization in July 2014, has a term of 20 years with an option to extend for a further ten years and is located in the prolific Rio del Rey Basin. The Bomono permit, located in an onshore extension of the Douala Basin, is characterized by numerous surface oil seeps and is under-explored using modern exploration methods. Bowleven has identified multiple Tertiary and Cretaceous age prospects and leads, as well as the hydrocarbons identified in the Moambe and Zingara exploration wells drilled in 2015.2017 was a transformative year for Bowleven, with significant changes in its Board and operating model. Major shareholder Crown Ocean Capital P1 Limited approached Eli Chahin and Chris Ashworth to be nominated as directors, leading to a General Meeting where they were elected and several other directors were removed. The new Board, led by Chahin as CEO and Ashworth as Chairman, focused on maximizing value from existing assets and reducing corporate expenses. The company's overhead base was substantially reduced, and the number of full-time employees was cut from 40 to fewer than ten. The Board is now aligned with Crown Ocean's ambition to deliver value for all shareholders and looks forward to executing its strategy from a sustainable footing, focusing on maximizing the value of its Etinde offshore interest and Bomono interest, and utilizing the prospective arrangement with VOG.
