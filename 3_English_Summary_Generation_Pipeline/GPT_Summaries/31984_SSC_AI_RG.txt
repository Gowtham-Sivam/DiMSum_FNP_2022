Caroline brings over 20 years of experience in the financial services industry, most recently as Head of UK Premier and Wealth at HSBC. She joins the group at an exciting point in its development. Discretionary funds under management grew substantially during the year, surpassing the significant milestone of £10bn in April 2017 and reaching £10.5bn as at 30 June 2017 (2016: £8.3bn), an increase of 25.9%. This compares to a 10.5% increase in the FTSE UK Private Investor Balanced Index and represents a combination of investment performance (14.5%) and continued organic growth (11.5%). Underlying profit before tax for the year was £18.4m (2016: £15.5m), an increase of 18.6% on the previous year, representing an underlying profit margin of 20.1% (2016: 19.1%). Underlying earnings per share also increased by 31.7% to 115.76p (2016: 87.92p). Statutory profit before tax for the year fell by 49.3% to £8.0m (2016: £15.9m), predominantly due to the decision to deal proactively with certain legacy matters arising from the former Spearpoint business. The company has announced the sale of Braemar Estates, its property management division, which will enable it to focus on its core businesses. The board has recommended a final dividend of 26.0p (2016: 23.0p) which, subject to approval by shareholders, will result in total dividends for the year of 41.0p (2016: 35.0p). This represents an increase of 17.1% on the previous year and reaffirms the board's confidence in the strength of the business and its commitment to a progressive dividend policy.
