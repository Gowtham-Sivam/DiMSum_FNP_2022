The company invested £8.5 million in R&D, sales, and business infrastructure. However, 2017 was a disappointing year in terms of safety, with the lost time accident rate increasing from 0.27 to 0.39. The company plans to improve safety through its 'thinkSAFE' program, launched in 2015. Two years into the initial three-year implementation phase of its strategy, the company is pleased with the progress made against its six execution priorities. The foundation for this progress has been operational improvements, which have allowed for increased investment in technology development, sales, and functional capability. The net debt to EBITDA ratio improved to 1.2x (2016: 1.6x) following the disposal of two businesses, and the Group remains well within its banking covenants. On a statutory reporting basis, operating profit improved to £158.1 million (2016: £107.3 million) and profit before tax improved to £135.8 million (2016: £87.9 million). The company's long-term strategy focuses on materials science capability and technology, application engineering capability, and customer and end-market focus. In 2018, the final year of the initial implementation phase, the company plans to invest a further £8 million in its capabilities, largely in technology and sales, funded through further operational improvements. The Group's 2017 revenue was £1,021.5 million, 3.3% above 2016, with an organic constant currency basis growth of 1.4%. The headline operating profit margin was 11.7% (2016: 11.8%), and headline earnings per share were 22.5 pence (2016: 22.7 pence). Capital expenditure was £34.4 million (2016: £39.5 million), and operating cash generation was strong, with a cash flow from operations of £129.5 million (2016: £128.3 million). Net debt at the year-end was £181.3 million (2016: £242.5 million).Morgan Advanced Materials' CEO, Pete Raby, outlined six execution priorities in the 2017 Annual Report to strengthen the company and deliver resilient financial performance and faster growth. These priorities include moving to a global business structure, improving technical leadership, enhancing operational execution, driving sales effectiveness and market focus, increasing investment in people management and development, and simplifying the business. The company has made significant progress in these areas, such as completing the move to a global business structure, increasing investment in research and development, generating net savings of £8.5 million through operational improvements, and completing two divestments to simplify the business. As the company enters 2018, global markets are generally in good health, and Morgan Advanced Materials expects to grow at closer to market growth rates. The company plans to invest further in the long-term health of the business and selectively invest in capacity to support growth where opportunities are attractive.
