Despite a successful year in 2017, the company faces a rapidly changing and increasingly competitive market, leading the Board to take decisive action in January 2018 to change its pricing strategy and market positioning in order to protect market share and recalibrate the Group for future growth. This new pricing strategy involves significantly reducing the price of some funerals and freezing the price of others, while maintaining excellent client service and leveraging the Group's scale to develop national recognition online. The company is also committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and ensuring a high level of cultural integrity within its operations.Dignity plc's 2017 Annual Report highlights a successful year with good performances from their crematoria and pre-need businesses. However, the funeral business experienced a decline in market share due to increased competition. As a result, the Board has taken decisive action to change the Group's pricing strategy and market positioning in the funeral business. Underlying operating profit increased three per cent to £104.6 million, with each operating division trading in line with the Board's expectations. The company continued to invest in supporting the existing network, acquiring well-reputed businesses, and developing new crematoria. In January 2018, the Board implemented pricing changes and began testing a range of new price points and services while preserving their unrivaled levels of service. The goal is to offer the best quality service at each price point and market segment, positioning themselves as the best value service provider in the market. The company is also undergoing a rigorous review to ensure funeral operations are organized more efficiently and effectively. The key challenge for 2018 is to find the optimum relationship between price, service, and demand for their funeral business. The increasingly competitive market led to the decision to change the pricing strategy and market positioning in early 2018. The company reduced the price of their simple funeral by an average of approximately 25 per cent and froze the price of traditional funerals in the majority of their locations. They anticipate that simple funerals may represent approximately 20 per cent of all funerals performed in 2018. The high quality of their offering, more competitively priced, is how they will differentiate themselves, locally and nationally.
