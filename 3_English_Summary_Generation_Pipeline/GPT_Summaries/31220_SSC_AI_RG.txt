Chairman's statement on Altyn plc Annual Report 2017The Chief Executive Officer's review highlights the company's progress in securing financing for equipment necessary to increase output from its current levels to an initial target of 40,000t a month, moving to 70,000t in 2019. Infrastructure enhancements and progress of the underground decline have been continuing throughout the year, providing a good foundation for increasing output once the equipment is in place. Production is planned to increase from Q3 2018, once the equipment is commissioned and delivered. The company has made significant progress in developing the underground mine, including the development of the decline, ore body preparation, and refurbishment of the processing plant. The company has also purchased a load-haul-dumper and a prospect drilling machine to improve efficiency and extraction of higher-grade ores. The decline was developed to the 150masl level, providing sufficient access to ore bodies for current planned production. The company expects production to increase gradually to a run rate of 70,000t a month once the new equipment is in place in Q3 2018. The company has entered into an agreement with Freedom Finance to raise $15m of the external funding requirement and is in discussions with another party to provide direct equipment financing. The operational performance of the company's Sekisovskoye gold mine during 2017 showed an increase in ore mined, but a decrease in underground gold grade due to the lack of available mining equipment. The company anticipates that the gold grade will increase as more targeted drilling is undertaken once the necessary equipment is available. The mineral processing has increased significantly, with gold production increasing from 10,970oz in 2016 to 16,717oz in 2017.
