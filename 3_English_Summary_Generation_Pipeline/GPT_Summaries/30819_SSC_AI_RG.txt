Advisors IntroductionNAHL Group plc operates in the UK Consumer Legal Services market across three divisions, with 220 staff members, supporting 151,178 consumers and employing 164 care experts. Their vision is to provide exceptional service to consumers and customers by excelling in all aspects of their work. Their mission is to become the leading provider in their chosen consumer legal services markets by creating trusted brands, forging strategic customer partnerships, and embracing developing technologies. Key milestones since flotation include the acquisition of Best Value Conveyancing in July 2015, Bush & Company Rehabilitation in October 2015, Fitzalan Partners in February 2015, and Searches UK in January 2016. They also established Your Law LLP with NewLaw Solicitors in July 2017 and a second ABS with Lyons Davidson Solicitors in November 2017. Their trading divisions include Personal Injury (National Accident Helpline), Critical Care (Bush & Company Rehabilitation), and Residential Property (Fitzalan Partners and Searches UK). The company's financial statements show revenues of £8.3m and underlying operating profit of £1.4m for Personal Injury, revenues of £11.0m and underlying operating profit of £3.9m for Critical Care, and revenues of £31.7m and underlying operating profit of £11.0m for Residential Property.NAHL Group's 2017 annual report highlights a strong performance despite considerable challenges faced during the year. The company's revenue increased to £51.9m, primarily due to a 5.5% increase in Personal Injury (PI) revenues. However, underlying operating profit declined to £14.5m, reflecting structural changes in the PI division as the company invested in cases through newly launched Alternative Business Structures (ABS). The Group's Critical Care division performed ahead of the previous year, with revenue up 6.6% to £11.0m, while the Residential Property division faced difficult market conditions, with revenue down 7.5% to £8.3m. The company's preparations for regulatory changes in the PI sector continue in 2018, with plans to establish a third ABS to provide digitally enabled consumer advice and support. The Board also intends to amend its dividend policy to fund further ABS investments, increasing dividend cover from 1.5x to 2.0x earnings per share. The outlook for 2018 is a year of transition and earnings contraction, with the company focusing on evolving its PI division, anticipating further growth from Critical Care, and maintaining operational efficiency in the challenging residential property market.NAHL Group's Chief Executive, Russell Atkinson, reported that the company delivered an underlying operating profit of £14.5m from an underlying revenue of £51.0m in 2017. The formation of two ABS ventures and working with a smaller number of more efficient panel law firms (PLFs) has improved the company's ability to manage demand. The initial KPIs from the ABS ventures have been encouraging, and the company continues to monitor them carefully. The relaunch of the National Accident Helpline brand has generated positive results, with trust scores almost 2.5 times better than their nearest competitor. The company's Critical Care (CC) division made progress in 2017, growing market share and developing a solid pipeline of contract wins. The Group's Residential Property (RP) business faced market headwinds, but focus on website conversion, margin management, and cost control enabled them to report profits in line with 2016. The Group continues to operate in the large and fragmented Consumer Legal Services (CLS) market, focusing on Personal Injury (PI) and Residential Property (RP). Despite regulatory uncertainty and market headwinds, the Group traded well during 2017, delivering underlying operating profit in line with expectations. The company's strategy includes extending ABS capability, further developing commercial models with PLF partners, evolving the National Accident Helpline brand, and building digital capability to enable a better experience for consumers. The company's outlook remains positive, with plans to increase investment in self-processing and grow market share in the challenging Residential Property market.
