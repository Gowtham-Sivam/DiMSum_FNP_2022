This success is attributed to the Group's diverse business model, strong international presence, and ability to innovate and grow new businesses.

The Board has proposed an increase in the final dividend to 19.3 pence per share, making a total for the year of 28.7 pence per share, a 10% increase compared to 2016.

The Group's international presence has also expanded, making it less dependent on any one geographical market. All four divisions are well-positioned for the future, with Marine Support benefiting from new markets, Specialist Technical holding market-leading positions in its niches, Tankships performing well in a stable market, and Offshore Oil positioned for recovery. The strength of the balance sheet allows for investment in development projects and capital investment, with a focus on organic growth and potential acquisitions. The Board has chosen Malcolm Paul to become Chairman at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting, and Justin Atkinson will join the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Fergus Graham will be appointed as an Executive Director, taking responsibility for the Marine Support division.

The strategic aim is to deliver long-term growth in earnings per share and consistently increase shareholder value. The Group's businesses target an operating margin of at least 10%, a pre-tax return on capital employed of at least 15%, and are expected to be cash-generative through careful management of working capital and investments. The Group prioritizes organic growth, supplemented with value-enhancing acquisitions that fit into existing divisions. James Fisher seeks to acquire businesses with niche product or service offerings, growth potential, profitability, cash generation, and strong management.
