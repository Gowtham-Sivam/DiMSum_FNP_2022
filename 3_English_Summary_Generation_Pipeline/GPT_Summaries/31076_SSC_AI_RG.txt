In 2017, Volga Gas experienced more stable conditions in the oil and gas industry worldwide and in Russia, allowing the company to enhance its operations. The most significant improvement was the switch to a Redox-based gas sweetening process at the Dobrinskoye gas processing plant, reducing chemical costs and eliminating the need for disposing of spent processing chemicals. Despite a reduction in plant throughput during the implementation, the impact on the Group's revenues was not as significant due to improved market conditions. The change to the Redox process required only modest capital expenditure, and the main focus of investment in 2017 was on two projects expected to provide incremental revenues and cash flow: the construction of a plant to capture liquid petroleum gases for sale and the drilling of a new horizontal oil well in the Uzen oil field. Revenues, EBITDA, and operating cash flow remained relatively stable, allowing for increased capital expenditure and dividend payments to shareholders. However, the company experienced a reduction in reserves due to higher formation water content in certain production wells, prompting an updated independent reserves report and a search for technical and operational solutions to mitigate the impact.In 2017, Volga Gas aimed to transform the technology used to process gas and condensate at the Dobrinskoye gas plant, which accounts for the majority of the Group's production, revenue, and profits. After extensive investigations and pilot tests, management decided to switch to Redox-based sweetening, which would not only reduce costs but also eliminate waste material requiring disposal. The switch to Redox processing began in May 2017, and by June, all gas processed at Dobrinskoye used Redox. Although the change was achieved at a low capital cost, plant throughput was initially kept low while process management was optimized. Throughput gradually increased, averaging 533,000 m3 per day in December 2017. However, the period of lower throughput led to an overall reduction in Group production, which was 24% lower than in 2016. To offset the reduction in volumes, oil prices and the Russian Ruble both recovered steadily throughout the year, lessening the impact of lower sales volumes on the Group's financial performance. In addition to the switch to Redox gas sweetening, Volga Gas undertook two major projects in 2017: the construction of an LPG unit at Dobrinskoye and the drilling of a horizontal well at the Uzen oil field in the Karpenskiy license. These projects were the main uses of capital investment in 2017 and are expected to contribute significantly to future revenues and profits. A new independent reserve report by Geostream Assets Management, dated 12 April 2018, resulted in a reduction of 27% in the proved and 28% in the proved plus probable reserve numbers for the Group's oil and gas reserves. The presence of formation water during gas production led Geostream to apply a more conservative calculation of ultimately recoverable reserves from the VM field. Management has adopted the revised reserve estimates for the 2017 year-end accounts and is actively looking into technical and operational solutions to mitigate the impact of the reserves reductions and maximize gas production. Key objectives for 2018 include increasing efficiency and processing capacity at the gas plant, commencing production and optimizing the marketing of LPG, completing reservoir and technical studies on the VM field, and optimizing oil production from the new horizontal well Uzen #101.
