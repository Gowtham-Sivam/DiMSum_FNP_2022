The company invests in new high-quality homes for rent, generating attractive and sustainable total returns for shareholders, supported by the reliable revenue from its regulated tenancy portfolio. Grainger's high-performing portfolio of residential rental properties provides strong capital growth and rental growth prospects, with assets well-located and achieving market-leading performance. The company has 4,789 private rented sector (PRS) homes in its portfolio, which are attractive to customers and outperform the market. Grainger's regulated tenancy portfolio generates stable and reliable cash flow of at least £100m per annum, with returns generated through rental income, capital growth, and the reversionary surplus. The company is reinvesting proceeds from regulated tenancies into higher-yielding new PRS homes, with a total investment pipeline of £651m secured, £243m in planning/legals, and £373m under consideration.The Chairman's statement highlights several factors driving the demand for renting and the growth of the rental market. According to Knight Frank, 37% of renters choose to rent due to lifestyle preferences rather than affordability issues. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reports that renting is increasing across all over-25 age groups, with a notable rise among 35-44 year olds from 19% to 26% in five years. This growing demand for rental homes supports the growth in net rental income. To cater to this diverse customer base, the company focuses on designing attractive products, positioning its brand, and conducting research to understand customer preferences. The statement also emphasizes the continued undersupply of homes, with 189,000 new homes built last year compared to an annual demand of 250,000 new households (ONS). This undersupply supports the company's strategy to create new homes for rent. Lastly, the professionalization of the rental market is discussed, with new buy-to-let lending down 41% and a 43% increase in supply from large-scale institutional investors in the private rented sector (PRS).The Chief Executive's review highlights the need for large-scale, professional landlords to provide good-quality rental homes due to a slowdown in rental homes provided by buy-to-let investors and only around 96,000 homes in the build-to-rent pipeline. To differentiate from buy-to-let rental housing, the focus is on providing a greater level of service, including longer-term tenancies and enhancing customer service through technology. Targeting regional cities with attractive investment characteristics and growth prospects is also emphasized. The political landscape and policy environment are seen as positive, with support from the UK Government, London Mayor, and local government for growth in the PRS and build-to-rent sector. However, there is some risk of populist policy proposals and additional regulatory burden. To promote the benefits of investment in the PRS and professionalize the sector, a comprehensive program of engagement with central government, the London Mayoral team, and local government is in place, along with active dialogue with all political parties and regular monitoring of political developments.
