This includes increasing headcount, adding new vertical specialisms, entering new or existing geographies, and starting up in niche sectors. To accelerate growth, the company also looks at external investments to fill gaps in sector or geographic coverage or to bring in specific market knowledge. External investment will occur where the company doesn’t currently have a presence in a region or sector, or to help develop an existing brand by filling in gaps in their service offering. The company's growth strategy is focused on developing leading specialist brands with sector expertise, maintaining diversification and balance by geography and sector, and developing a solid financial foundation. In 2017, Empresaria Group successfully integrated two new brands into the Group from external investments made in 2016, Rishworth Aviation and ConSol Partners, and merged a number of brands in the UK to bring operational synergies and cost savings to the businesses.
