The loss before impairment for the year was £406,000, compared to a profit of £1,334,000 in 2016. The adjusted net asset value of the Group was £1.60 per share, down from £1.96 in 2016. The company acquired five corporate members during 2017, increasing capacity for the 2015 to 2017 years of account. The adjusted net asset value per share declined due to funding the loss and the fall in capacity value. The Board recommends a final dividend of 1.5p per share, the same as last year, but no special dividend this year due to opportunities for acquisitions at favorable prices and the possibility of share buybacks. The company's strategy of building a capacity portfolio of the better available syndicates at Lloyd's should allow Helios to maintain its outperformance of returns on capacity against the Lloyd's market. Lower auction values and prospective 2017 underwriting year losses present an opportunity to continue building the portfolio of capacity by purchasing LLVs at lower values.Helios Underwriting's Chief Executive, Nigel Hanbury, highlights the company's continued strategy of building a quality portfolio of syndicate capacity, which increased by 26% from £32.6m to £41.0m in 2017. The use of quota share has provided finance for acquisitions and mitigated the loss from 2017 catastrophe losses. The reduction of the value of the capacity portfolio to £13.0m (2016: £14.9m) will provide opportunities to acquire further LLVs at reduced prices. Helios' portfolio underwriting results for 2015 underwriting year outperformed Lloyd's return on capacity by 6.6%, demonstrating the quality of the portfolio. Market conditions for underwriting are improving after the 2017 losses, and with the prospect of improving underwriting returns, together with the opportunity to acquire LLVs at lower values, Helios is well placed to deliver value to shareholders in the future. The company's growth in capacity through acquisitions has continued through the purchase of further corporate members, with £4.4m of capacity acquired in 2017. Helios remains focused on the quality of syndicates and has outperformed the Lloyd's market average, with an average return on capacity of 14.2% over the last three closed years.
