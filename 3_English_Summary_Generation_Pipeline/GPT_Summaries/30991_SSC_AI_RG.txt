Ergomed's highlights include the acquisition of PSR Group BV, a Netherlands-based contract research organization focused on orphan drug development, for up to €5.7 million (£5.1 million) in October 2017. The company also raised £2.9 million through an institutional placing to partially fund the initial consideration for PSR in September 2017. PrimeVigilance, Ergomed's drug safety and medical information division, showcased its successful pilot project in robotic automation at an intelligent automation seminar for the International Society of Pharmacovigilance (ISOP) in December 2017. Ergomed made several board and management appointments, including Peter George as Chairman, Dr. Miroslav Reljanovic as Executive Vice-Chairman, Stephen Stamp as CEO, and Jan Petracek as COO. The company also entered into a multi-study co-development partnership with Allergy Therapeutics plc to support three of their OralVac products in December 2017.

The medically led organization, which includes the recently re-branded PharmInvent, is known for its commitment to quality, resulting in exceptional client retention and organic growth.

The company has completed over 600 studies and processed more than 80,000 adverse event cases annually. Ergomed's growth rates surpass global industry growth, with a 9% overall growth and 3% organic growth in Clinical Research Services, and a 68% overall growth and 35% organic growth in Drug Safety and Medical Information.In 2017, Ergomed saw continued strong performance in its services business, particularly in the Drug Safety and Medical Information sector. The Board identified significant opportunities in specialist CRO services, such as orphan drug development, where Ergomed can take global leadership positions and continue to grow. The appointment of Stephen Stamp as CEO and Dr Jan Petracek as COO led to a review of Ergomed’s growth opportunities and strategic priorities, resulting in a greater focus on the services business. The co-development pipeline remains a differentiator for the CRO business, but expansion will not be a strategic priority. The company plans to pursue further development of the Haemostatix assets through partnerships and collaborations. The successful integration of pharmacovigilance services under the PrimeVigilance brand and the acquisition of PSR, a specialist orphan CRO, contribute to a firm foundation for the company’s strategic priorities. Ergomed's services businesses provide differentiated offerings in growth markets with drug development upside potential, driven by favorable market trends such as outsourcing and high growth in the drug safety and medical information segment.The Chief Executive Officer reports strong growth in the company's service businesses, with clinical success and significant opportunities to expand in the pharmaceutical services market.
