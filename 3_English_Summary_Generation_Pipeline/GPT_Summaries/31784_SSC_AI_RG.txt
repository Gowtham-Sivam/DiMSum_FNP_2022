Staunton thanked employees for their ongoing commitment and hard work, and expressed confidence in the company's position for the year ahead despite economic uncertainty.Travel delivered a strong revenue performance across all channels, with trading profit increasing by ten per cent to £96m, including £9m from the growing International business. Travel now represents over 60 per cent of Group profit from trading operations. The company opened 15 new units in the UK during the year, taking the total to 582 units. They also won a further 41 units in the International business, including a significant win in Changi Airport in Singapore and their first stores in Italy, making a total of 273 international units won, of which 233 are open. High Street delivered a good performance, with trading profit at £62m. Cost savings of £12m were delivered in the year, with an additional £9m of cost savings identified over the next three years. Diluted earnings per share increased by ten per cent to 103.6p, reflecting the increase in profit and a lower basic weighted average number of shares in issue following the share buyback. The Group remains highly cash generative and has a strong balance sheet, with net funds at £4m and a Group free cash flow of £105m. The Board has proposed a final dividend of 33.6p per share, a ten per cent increase on last year, giving a total dividend per ordinary share of 48.2p, a ten per cent increase on the prior year. The annual dividend has now increased every year since demerger from 11.8p in 2007 to 48.2p for 2017. Both the Travel and High Street businesses are cash generative and the company allocates capital efficiently, investing in the business and new opportunities where they can achieve an attractive return ahead of their cost of capital, making appropriate acquisitions, consistently growing dividends, and returning cash to shareholders as part of their long-term strategy to create value for shareholders. Since 2007, including the share buyback announced on 12 October 2017 and the proposed final dividend, the company will have returned over £900m of cash to shareholders, increased the dividend each year, and reduced their issued share capital by 40 per cent.
