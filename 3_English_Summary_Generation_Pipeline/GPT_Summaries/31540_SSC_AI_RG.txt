The company's core elements of value to customers and innovation have remained consistent throughout its history and are expected to continue as the foundation for a sustainable and prosperous future. In the 2016/17 financial year, the Group's results were impacted by the 2015 collapse in global oil & gas prices, but management took action to maintain profitability by reducing costs. The Board remains committed to preserving the critical capability that underlies Synectics' leading market position in the sector and focusing on gaining market share once the recovery is underway. Other factors influencing the company's results include a buoyant global gaming market, increased demand from infrastructure customers, and a decline in new bus deliveries in the UK. The Board is pleased with the company's performance for 2016/17, which was in line with expectations, and expects the trend of growing profitability to continue in the current financial year. The Board has also authorized a significant increase in research & development expense to capitalize on opportunities for innovative development of Synectics' core product set, using emerging technology applications to expand offerings to current markets. For the year to 30 November 2017, Synectics' consolidated revenue was £70.1 million, with a 15% increase in underlying profit before tax to £3.0 million. The Group's balance sheet continued to strengthen, with net cash at £3.8 million and a consolidated firm order book at £24.4 million. The Board is recommending an increased final dividend of 3.0p per share. Synectics' strategy remains to create leadership positions within specialized sectors of the electronic security and surveillance industry through a combination of expert, sector-specific market knowledge and proprietary technologies. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing complexity of extracting meaningful and actionable intelligence from the increasing volume of digital data generated by high-end, video-centric security systems. The 2018 financial year has begun in line with the Board's expectations, with growth in profits expected for the Integration & Managed Services division and varying revenue and profit trends for the Systems division's major end-user segments. The Board has authorized an increase of approximately £500,000 in research & development expense to accelerate Synectics' development of its core software product base, capitalizing on the company's established customer base and trusted reputation for successful technical innovation.Synectics Chief Executive Paul Webb is proud of the company's 30-year journey, which began with an innovative solution for controlling and switching images in large CCTV systems. The company has since expanded its operations and now serves leading organizations in the transport, oil & gas, gaming, critical infrastructure, and retail sectors, with major regional centers in the US, Singapore, the UAE, Germany, and the UK. Despite the growth in scale and geographical scope, Synectics has remained true to its core values of being an innovative, problem-solving, customer-driven company. The security and surveillance business faces specific challenges, such as the need for robust and rigorously proven systems, as well as adapting to new types of potential threats. The rapid pace of technological change, including artificial intelligence, driverless vehicles, and the internet of things, is prompting customers to seek agility, intuitiveness, integration, and pre-emption in their security solutions. Synectics is confident in its ability to meet these challenges and continue to provide high-quality solutions and customer service, while staying true to the values that inspired the company's creation.
