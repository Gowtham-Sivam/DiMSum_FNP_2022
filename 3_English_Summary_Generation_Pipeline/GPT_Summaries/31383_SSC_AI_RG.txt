Phoenix Global Resources plc was created on 10 August 2017, following the completion of a strategic combination. The company generated revenues of US$141.8 million and an adjusted EBITDAX of US$40.6 million, excluding non-recurring expenses of US$32.9 million. However, it reported an operating loss of US$275.0 million. Phoenix Global Resources has integrated offices, reorganized operational and business support teams, and secured operatorship and significant acreage at Rio Atuel, Mata Mora, and Corralera, with 560,000 net Vaca Muerta shale acres.Phoenix Global Resources is well-positioned to participate in Argentina's shale revolution, with a 7.5% stake in Vaca Muerta net acreage and 1% of total Argentine production in 2017. The company has an operational center in Mendoza and strong relationships with the government and partners. It also has access to global equity from the UK, US, Europe, Asia, and Latin America, as well as the ability to source local and international finance. Phoenix is applying the latest shale and unconventional technology from its technical center in Houston to accelerate development in the Vaca Muerta region. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange (AIM: PGR) and Buenos Aires Stock Exchange (BCBA: PGR). Argentina's pro-business government is driving reforms and deregulation of capital markets, leading to increased foreign direct investments and portfolio flows. The Vaca Muerta formation is a world-class unconventional resource play, with significant investment from major players such as Chevron, Shell, Total, and ExxonMobil. The Argentine oil and gas industry benefits from established infrastructure, skilled personnel, and a positive regulatory environment.In the Chairman's statement, Sir Michael Rake discusses his involvement with British-Argentine commerce and business since 2001 and highlights the significant changes in Argentina's political and economic landscape since the Macri administration came into power in 2015. The new administration has implemented business-friendly policies, attracting foreign capital investment, particularly in the oil industry. The Argentine Peso has been deregulated, and the government has introduced labor, tax, and capital market reforms to attract investment and reactivate the economy. The backdrop of these changes led to the successful combination of Andes Energia and Trefoil Holdings B.V. in August 2017, creating Phoenix Global Resources. The company has quadrupled in scale, enhanced its operating capability, and strengthened its financial position. Phoenix is now set to capitalize on the significant unconventional oil and gas growth opportunities in Argentina, including the world-class Vaca Muerta shale formation. The Chairman also emphasizes the importance of strong corporate governance and the new board's experience in the oil and gas industry.In the Chief Executive Officer's statement, Phoenix Global Resources highlights its growth potential, with 57.2 MMboe 2P reserves, 207 MMboe contingent resources (3C), and 1,795 MMboe contingent and prospective resources (3C + 3Pr). The company consolidated its teams in Buenos Aires in October 2017, moving into new offices at Torre Alem Plaza, and opened its technical excellence center in Houston in April 2018. This has allowed for better integration, technology transfer, and access to experienced service providers and consultants. Phoenix has also strengthened its team in Mendoza with new appointments. The company is focused on unconventional regulations in Mendoza, which provide a framework for responsible appraisal and evaluation activities in the northern part of the Neuquina basin. Phoenix continues to evaluate non-organic growth opportunities, including participating in new license bid rounds and third-party sale processes. The 2018 accelerated business plan more than doubles the 2017 capital expenditure program, with 70% focused on unconventional appraisal and evaluation. The company is committed to building value over the medium to long term, focusing on proving up and de-risking its extensive unconventional acreage, building its organization for large scale development, and pursuing opportunistic inorganic growth through farm-ins, joint ventures, partnerships, and portfolio rationalization.
