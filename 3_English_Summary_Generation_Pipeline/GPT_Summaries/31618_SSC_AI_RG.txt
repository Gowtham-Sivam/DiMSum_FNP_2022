In 2017, ITE Group's TAG programme made significant progress, assembling the right team, structure, and processes to ensure success. The benefits of the TAG initiatives are already evident through growth in Core events and forward bookings. ITE is well-positioned to achieve its vision of creating the world's leading portfolio of content-driven, must-attend events that deliver outstanding experiences and ROI for customers. The company has set a fast pace in the last year and looks forward to continuing this momentum into 2018 and beyond.ITE Group's Chairman's Statement highlights the company's period of transformation, embracing dynamic change and a renewed energy for success. The Annual Report for the year ended 30 September 2017 demonstrates a return to growth during a year of substantial change. Mark Shashoua's first full year as CEO and Andrew Beach's appointment as CFO led to a full strategic review of the business, resulting in an evolved strategy focused on generating organic growth around market-leading events. This includes significant investment in event content and marketing, aiming to make leading shows 'must-visit' events in their sectors. The Group has also adopted a new 'sales-led' culture to drive revenue and invested in a central best practice team to ensure consistent high-quality experiences for exhibitors and visitors worldwide. The TAG programme, which involves investing up to £20m over the next three years, is expected to yield strong returns by 2020 and has received support from shareholders.The Chief Executive Officer's statement highlights a like-for-like revenue growth of 5% to £152.6m, marking the first year of growth in four years due to the implementation of the Group's new strategy. Headline profit before tax was lower at £31.6m after investing in the new TAG programme, and the loss before tax was £3.2m. Net debt was reduced by 16% to £49.7m. The economy in Russia, particularly Moscow, is showing signs of improvement, but challenges persist in other markets. The full year dividend per share is proposed at 4.0p, with a final dividend of 2.5p to be paid on 5 February 2018. The Board remains focused on strong corporate governance and implementing robust processes to mitigate risk and deliver best practices. Marco Sodi stepped down from the Board after five years, having also stepped down as Company Chairman in July 2017.
