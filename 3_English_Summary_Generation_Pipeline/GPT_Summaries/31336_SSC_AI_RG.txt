The strong performance is attributed to the continuation of the company's proven strategy to supplement strong organic growth with acquisitions that extend the Group's services and geographical reach. The company made eleven acquisitions during the year, including two of its largest to date, VMC and Sperasoft. These acquisitions have enabled Keywords to form a new Engineering service line of scale, add co-development expertise, expand the capacity of and capabilities within existing service lines considerably, and extend its geographical reach into Eastern Europe. The company has also invested in expanding capacity at many of its studios, including Montreal, Zhengzhou, Manila, Dublin, Madrid, and Tokyo, with further investments in expansion planned for 2018.

The company entered 2018 with pro forma revenues of €225m derived from a more diversified, better balanced business with an expanded range of services and locations that will support its aim to increasingly become a key strategic partner to major games companies.Keywords Studios delivered a strong performance in 2017, with good like-for-like growth from existing businesses and the successful integration of 11 acquisitions that significantly enhanced the company's services platform. The company's strategy is to build the world's leading creative and technical services platform focused on the most complex of interactive content, particularly video games. The key pillars of this strategy are to grow organically and by acquisition to extend the Group's service capacity, capabilities, and geographical reach. In 2017, Keywords successfully executed 11 acquisitions, adding to all seven of its service lines and demonstrating the strength of its leadership team. The addition of Engineering services as the seventh service line filled an important gap in the company's palette of services, and the company looks forward to continuing to build this business in 2018 and beyond. The company has also successfully extended its geographic reach, adding operations in Eastern Europe for the first time through the acquisition of Sperasoft. The company's organic growth was driven in part by further strong progress with extending client relationships, as evidenced by a 45% increase in clients using three or more services from 64 in 2016 to 93 in 2017. The company's outlook for 2018 is positive, with early wins of co-development projects and increasing demand for integrated delivery of Engineering and Art services.
