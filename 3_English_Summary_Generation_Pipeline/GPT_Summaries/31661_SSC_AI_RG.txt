Urban&Civic's Chairman, Alan Dickinson, reports continued advancement in the financial year, with significant progress made since September. The Group has sold almost half of its remaining commercial and leisure assets, and has redeployed some of the proceeds into the purchase of Priors Hall in Northamptonshire. Urban&Civic aims to challenge standard approaches to large-scale housing delivery, focusing on strategic sites within 100 miles of London and the largest provincial cities. Their Master Developer model emphasizes quality and accelerated delivery, working with expansionist housebuilders to shorten the period between consent being granted and first construction. Priors Hall is part of a series of six strategic projects, and its purchase will enable Urban&Civic to take on new major propositions not yet adopted in Local Plans. The Oxford to Cambridge rail line is being designed to encourage incremental housing and re-establish transport links across the middle of the country, playing to the strengths of Urban&Civic's management in combining placemaking with transport. Shareholders should not interpret recent realizations as a sign that the company is giving up on commercial development; instead, anything of scale will be forward funded in the future. Institutional pre-funding is consistent with the Board's policy of a high level of financial prudence. Gearing is moving up slightly as strategic spend increases, but the Group's project facilities are primarily from the Homes and Communities Agency, whose interests align closely with Urban&Civic's. The company's partnerships with Aviva, Dioceses of the Church of England, the Ministry of Defence, and Trusts from Nuffield College and Oxford University are a testament to their financial approach and commitment to doing things the right way. Jon Di-Stefano, CEO of Telford Homes Plc, has joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director, bringing knowledge of quality housebuilding and adapting a business to incorporate high levels of institutional partnership funding. Despite challenging conditions and uncertainties, Urban&Civic has made significant progress in a short time, with employment levels in their selected areas of high population growth at record highs. The company continues to work towards further achievements.Urban&Civic's Chief Executive, Nigel Hugill, reported good results for the company, with significant positives to their enlarging business base. EPRA net assets per share were up 7.1% to 304.4p as at 30 September 2017, and EPRA net assets reached £439.3 million, compared with £409.8 million at 30 September 2016. The company's core reason for establishment was to provide new housing choices and accelerate supply through Master Development, and their results demonstrate the extent to which the Master Developer model is working financially as well as philosophically. The recent commercial asset realizations reflect the determination of the Board to position the balance sheet in the direction that the Company holds clear competitive advantage. Urban&Civic is now five years forward sold across four sites to a range of successful housebuilders with license participations or overage in practically all instances. The company's Master Developer model is halving the time from outline planning to start on site and thereafter they are on track to double historic rates of delivery. This is transformational to project economics and political credibility.
