CPPGroup Plc's 2017 Annual Report highlights a transformational year with a Q4 customer number breakthrough and further foundations for growth.In 2017, CPPGroup experienced significant growth, particularly in India and Turkey, due to the creation of mutually beneficial relationships with business partners through their traditional B2B2C model and strategic investment in key markets. The company's European businesses maintained strong retention performance, positioning them well for growth in 2018. CPPGroup works with partners to deliver bespoke, innovative prevention, protection, and assistance products and services, providing end-to-end management from white-labelled products to fulfillment.

This approach has supported the growth of India and Turkey, and they plan to continue investing in these markets, as well as expanding into new markets like Bangladesh in mid-2018.CPPGroup Plc's Chairman emphasizes the importance of the UK market as a key component of their global business. The company is leveraging Blink's technical expertise to develop innovative product solutions, such as the recent launch of Owl in Turkey. They are also seeking product extensions to their portfolio, including a recent investment in a minority shareholding in KYND Limited, a cyber security monitoring and diagnostics business. The Chairman highlights the importance of culture and values, with a focus on quality and integrity in their B2B2C distribution model. Significant investment has been made in developing an open, honest, and authentic culture throughout the organization. The Board has welcomed two new Directors, Oliver Laird as Chief Financial Officer and Tim Elliott as Non-Executive Director and Audit Committee Chairman. The Board is committed to maintaining high standards of governance, both at a corporate level and operationally throughout the business. They recognize the importance of retaining clear oversight and a flat organization structure, with Country CEOs reporting directly to the Group CEO. The Group's revenue growth in the year has been largely driven by India, where they are beginning to see the results of strategies and investments implemented.The Chief Executive Officer's statement highlights significant changes and strategic decisions made by CPP in the past 12 to 18 months, resulting in year-on-year revenue growth for the first time since 2011 and a significant increase in the global customer base. The growth has primarily been achieved through progress made in the Indian and Turkish operations, with a focus on strengthening business partner relationships and developing bespoke product offerings that meet local consumer needs. The company has also acquired Blink, an innovative product and systems developer, and has continued to invest in its growth. Cost control remains an integral part of the strategy, with a fundamental redesign of the organizational structure to promote a simplified business model and operating structure. The new structure will provide a lowering of overall cost and will be more responsive to country needs. The company has also made progress in freeing up capital for reinvestment into markets or enhancing capabilities through partnerships or acquisitions. The available capital created through these milestones will be used to support growth in rapidly expanding international markets, with enhanced investment plans already implemented in key markets such as India, Turkey, and China. CPP also plans to re-enter the UK market during 2018 and will look to acquire or partner with other innovation technology businesses to expand its product portfolio or capitalize on distribution networks.
