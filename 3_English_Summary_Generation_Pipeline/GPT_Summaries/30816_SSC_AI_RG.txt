Cloudcall Group plc reported a 42% increase in revenues to £6.9m in 2017, up from £4.9m in 2016. Recurring revenues also saw a 55% increase compared to the previous year, with 87% of income now either recurring or repeating. The company's gross margin rose to 80%, while EBITDA loss (excluding share-based payments) was reduced to £1.9m. Cloudcall raised £5.7m in new equity during the year and had £4.9m in cash at year-end. The company also reported a 45% increase in users to 23,520 and an increase in customers to 875. The average customer size grew to 27 users, a 24% increase year on year. Cloudcall's relationship with Bullhorn has strengthened, offering further growth opportunities following Bullhorn's acquisitions of Connexys, Talentrover, and Jobscience. The company successfully launched its new unified communications architecture to Bullhorn customers in Q4 and introduced a new Microsoft Dynamics CRM integration built on CloudCall's new unified communications architecture. Instant Messaging/SMS functionality is expected to launch during Q2'18.Customer satisfaction continues to rise, with support ratings averaging 96% and a 10% reduction in monthly churn rates achieved over the year. However, growth rates were constrained by limited cash resources, which restricted investment in sales and marketing activity. This lack of dedicated resources held back the rate of new customer acquisition, particularly in the US. In 2017, the focus was on strengthening the foundations for future growth, with additional funds raised allowing for expansion in sales and marketing functions. Resource limitations were also felt in product development, with much of the year spent rebuilding the core infrastructure into a robust, multi-channel communications platform to enable faster scaling in 2018. This shift was driven by the millennial generation's preference for texting and instant messaging over traditional communication methods. The new platform architecture improves consistency, lowers maintenance overheads, allows for faster deployment of new functionality, and increases the ease and speed of new integrations with additional CRMs. The updated solution also significantly improves the user interface and provides a more intuitive user journey. Development work on building SMS and instant messaging services has been progressing well, with a scheduled release in May 2018. Strengthening ties with Bullhorn has also improved lead flow to CloudCall from Bullhorn's own sales teams.In 2017, CloudCall Group plc saw significant growth in its user base, particularly in the recruitment and staffing sector, which employs over 12 million people globally. The company's integrated communications products have been well-received in this sector, as they help firms increase their speed in contacting candidates. CloudCall's strong relationship with Bullhorn, a leading provider of recruitment CRM software, has also contributed to its success in this market. In March 2018, Bullhorn announced the acquisitions of Talentrover and Jobscience, both recruitment CRMs built on the Force.com platform, which presents a significant opportunity for CloudCall to expand its addressable market. As a result, the company has decided to focus more heavily on the recruitment and staffing sector before exploring other markets. Over the year, staff numbers at CloudCall increased from 89 to 119, reflecting the company's desire to capitalize on the market opportunity that exists today. The company is also investing in improving its staff mentoring, training, and support mechanisms, as well as participating in various charity and community initiatives. In terms of outlook, CloudCall's recurring revenue continues to grow, and the company has reported strong sales in January and February, with trading in line with expectations.
