They have already made progress in implementing the strategy and are on track to deliver annualized savings of £10m-£14m. An agreement with Unipart was reached in principle at the end of 2017 and finalized on 13 February 2018, allowing significant changes to the supply chain and optimizing the network. This will result in improved product availability and contribute annualized cost savings of around £11m. The company saw an improving trend in performance in the second half of the financial year, with strong Adjusted EBITA growth compared to the first half.

The strategic review process has provided a clear direction for the company, with a focus on restoring the business to historic performance levels. The review identified three strategic priorities: repairing the Tool Hire business, strengthening the commercial proposition, and deleveraging the Group. Immediate actions include a cost reduction program, optimizing branch performance, rationalizing the product base, and improving customer profitability. The company will also focus on customer segmentation, geographic focus, and sales channel development. The positive trading momentum from the second half of 2017 has continued into 2018, with underlying revenue growing by 6% in the first quarter. The company expects to complete refinancing during 2018 and has prepared the accounts on a going concern basis. The Board has decided not to pay a final dividend for 2017 in order to focus on reducing net debt. The company's future focus will be on developing a leaner operation, improving product availability and customer service, and reducing debt to manageable levels.
