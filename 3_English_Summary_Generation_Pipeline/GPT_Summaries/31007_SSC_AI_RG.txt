They also launched Rightmove Discover, a product that uses predictive analytics to identify the most likely potential sellers in a local area and markets to them on behalf of an agent. In 2018, they plan to launch Rightmove Active Display, which will allow New Homes customers to target their potential audience on Rightmove based on the home hunter's usage of Rightmove over time, not just their current search criteria.
