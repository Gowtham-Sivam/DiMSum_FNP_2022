Local and smaller projects remain the foundation of Keller, supported by an extensive branch network and skilled local teams. The company also had significant success in the large project domain, with the Caspian project setting a benchmark for well-conceived and executed efforts in challenging environments. Most projects generated around £370m of gross profit in 2017, but underperformance in APAC due to difficult pricing and contractual environments led to losses on two major Australian projects. Risk and opportunity management remain a focus area, with lessons learned from loss-making projects being shared and absorbed throughout the group. The company continues to invest in people, appointing new leaders in several business units and launching a global Project Manager Academy to develop leadership skills.
