The Group purchased several properties, including Beacon Reach, a Children's Residential and Education facility near Preston for £4m. This facility is a significant addition for ROC NW, who recently won the Laing and Buisson Award in Social Care for Children's Services. CareTech continues to explore other acquisition opportunities and is confident that the remaining share placement proceeds will be deployed in a timely manner on earnings-enhancing businesses or projects. In 2017, the Group closed several services for reconfiguration, impacting revenue growth. However, better fees following reconfiguration, cost-saving initiatives, and the time and attendance system have improved underlying EBITDA. The Group's organic development program will continue with further reconfigurations, and for 2018, there is a strong pipeline of development opportunities with two property purchases registered soon after the year-end. On 28 March 2017, 344,305 new ordinary shares were issued as part of the arrangements for the full and final settlement of the earn-out agreed with the vendors of ROC North West, which was acquired in 2015.CareTech Holdings PLC's Chief Executive's Statement and Performance Review highlights the company's commitment to delivering high-quality care and maintaining well-maintained premises.
