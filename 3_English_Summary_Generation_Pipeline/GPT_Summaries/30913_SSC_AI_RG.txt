In 2018, Centrica's focus is on strategy delivery and performance management, prioritizing the performance of existing businesses over expansion. The company has revised its approach to risk management, focusing on process safety, political pressures, strategic delivery, cybersecurity, capability development, and leadership succession. Centrica is proposing a new Remuneration Policy to tie annual bonuses more closely to shareholder experience and add a Total Shareholder Return measure to the Long Term Incentive Plan. No annual bonuses or pay rises were awarded to Executive Directors for 2017, and stock awards will be reduced if the new policy is adopted. The company is committed to closing the gender pay gap and improving employee engagement. Centrica is also seeking a new Non-Executive Director to bring digital insights and the voice of the customer into the boardroom. The company's vision is clear, and they are confident in returning Centrica to real and sustainable growth.Centrica's Group Chief Executive, Iain Conn, states that the company's focus on home energy management and development of Hive is a natural extension of their in-home services business. He acknowledges the loss of 1.35 million customer accounts in 2017 but highlights the growth in other areas, such as 18% growth in protection plans in the US and 71% growth in installed hubs for Connected Home. Conn emphasizes the importance of focusing on value, not volume, and maintaining cost efficiency in their customer businesses. He expresses opposition to price controls in competitive retail energy markets, believing they will reduce competition and choice. Instead, Centrica aims to improve the market by increasing customer engagement, driving cost efficiency, improving service levels, rewarding loyalty, and delivering propositions that customers want. The company has made several acquisitions to enhance its capabilities and technologies, and has reduced costs through its £750 million cost efficiency program. The next phase of Centrica's strategic repositioning is focused on performance delivery and financial discipline, targeting an average of £2.1–£2.3 billion of adjusted operating cash flow per annum and maintaining net debt within a £2.25–£3.25 billion range.
