Camellia reported a profit of £28.6 million for 2017, compared to a loss of £5.9 million in 2016, which includes a £19.2 million gain from the sale of Duncan Lawrie's UK asset management business. The company made a small acquisition of a packet tea business in India and acquired a majority shareholding in Jing Tea, a UK-based distributor of branded specialty teas. Camellia decided to sell two of its smaller engineering businesses, BMT (Great Yarmouth) and GU Cutting and Grinding. Trading in 2017 was mixed, with tea operations performing well due to good yields and improving tea prices, but the macadamia crop was impacted by drought. The company's diversified agricultural strategy continues to provide excellent returns, despite challenges from unstable global political atmosphere and changing weather patterns. The Board is recommending a final dividend of 98p per share, bringing the total distribution for the year to 135p per share, compared to 130p per share for 2016. Early signs of a better macadamia crop, good tea prices in Q1 2018, and continuing strength in UK markets give reasons for optimism.Camellia's Chief Executive's report highlights the company's unchanged overall group strategy, with each division expected to perform against agreed divisional strategies with short, medium, and long-term goals and targets. The Agriculture division, which is the largest and offers the best long-term investment opportunities, will focus on core crops of tea, macadamia, and avocado, and maintain a portfolio of non-core crops to shield the group from climate change and commodity price fluctuations. The Engineering division will take advantage of the recovering oil sector while diversifying into adjacent sectors, and continue to grow Abbey Metal Finishing and its joint venture in Germany, Atfin, as quality suppliers to the aerospace industry. The Food Service division will continue to operate as a high-quality business in the storage and distribution of frozen foods, aiming to achieve critical mass by profitable growth and, if appropriate, acquisition. The Group's investment portfolio strategy remains to invest in high-quality companies where there is long-term value, and to balance geographic risk exposure. The Group has three associate companies in the financial services sector, with BF&M, the listed Bermudian insurance business, being the most significant. The Agriculture division made a trading profit of £35.6 million on revenue of £239.4 million, while the Engineering division made a trading loss of £2.6 million on revenue of £20.5 million. The Food Service division made a trading profit of £1.8 million on revenue of £37.8 million. The Group is committed to environmental and social sustainability, investing in initiatives to reduce its environmental impact and ensure the well-being of the communities in which it operates.
