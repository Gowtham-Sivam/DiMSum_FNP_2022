The company has acquired three sites in 2017 and plans to acquire two to four sites per year in the medium term.

The company also completed the installation of the innovative Pins & Strings technology at five sites during the second half of FY17 at a total cost of £1.0m. This technology is expected to improve cost efficiency and customer experience, with plans to roll it out across the estate over time. Securing the future of the estate is a key priority, with lease re-gears and improved rental terms being sought during FY18. The company's commitment to people and their development has resulted in exceptional customer service and a significant improvement in the Net Promoter Score from 49% in FY16 to 66% in FY17.
