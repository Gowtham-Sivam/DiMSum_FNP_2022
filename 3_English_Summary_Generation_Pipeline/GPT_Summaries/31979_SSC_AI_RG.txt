Avanti Communications Group reported a revenue of $56.6m for the full year of 2017, a decrease from the previous year's $82.8m. The company faced a significant provision against receivable from the Government of Indonesia and impairment charges against HYLAS 1, HYLAS 2, and Filiago. A finance restructuring plan was launched to equitize all of the 2023 notes and reduce the interest rate on the 2021 notes. Cash at the end of the year was $32.7m, down from $56.4m in 2016, while net debt decreased to $562.0m from $588.9m. CEO David Williams stepped down shortly after the year end.In the first half of the financial year, Avanti faced financial disruption as additional debt facilities were not available on suitable terms. However, the company secured $242 million of additional liquidity through refinancing transactions supported by existing bondholders and long-term investors. This disruption led to a longer sales cycle, causing revenues to be significantly lower than expected. Despite this, Avanti secured a new 3-year contract worth up to $21 million to deploy services to government sites across Africa and made progress on the SaT5G project, which aims to integrate satellite communications into 5G networks. Following the departure of CEO David Williams, Alan Harper took on the role of interim Chief Executive, focusing on rebuilding sales momentum and developing a market strategy. The Board has launched a restructuring of the company's balance sheet, aiming to reduce debt by over $500 million and cut annual interest charges by approximately 70%. This restructuring is subject to shareholder approval at a General Meeting in early 2018. Chairman Paul Walsh expressed gratitude to employees, customers, suppliers, and investors for their ongoing support.Avanti Communications Group's Chief Executive, Alan Harper, reported that trading in the first half of the year was slower than expected due to uncertainty associated with the strategic review initiated in July 2016. However, since the conclusion of the review and the successful provision of additional financing, the company has won significant new business and expects pipeline conversion rates to accelerate. In the second half of the year, Avanti secured contract wins across all four markets of Broadband, Government, Enterprise, and Backhaul, including the Satellite and Terrestrial Network for 5G (SaT5G) project, the ERDF contract for rural broadband services in Cornwall and Isles of Scilly, and a partnership with Millicom to bring broadband connectivity to Sub-Saharan Africa. The company has impaired the carrying value of HYLAS 1 and HYLAS 2 satellites due to falling capacity prices and the finite life of the satellites, but both are expected to generate strong EBITDA and cash flows as revenues grow. The HYLAS 4 satellite, which will complete Avanti's coverage of EMEA, is now expected to be delivered in January 2018 with a launch in March 2018. The company is confident that the arbitration panel will rule in its favor regarding a government receivable provision and is in discussion with current and new distributors to sign up master partnership distribution agreements for the HYLAS 4 capacity.
