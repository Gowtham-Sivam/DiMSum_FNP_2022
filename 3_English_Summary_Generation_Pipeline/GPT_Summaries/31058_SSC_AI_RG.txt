Hurricane Energy is a new generation oil company that focuses on discovering, appraising, and developing oil from fractured basement reservoirs. These reservoirs are composed of very hard rocks such as granite, with oil held in fractures formed over the past 2.5 billion years. Hurricane is the first oil company to target fractured basements in the UK, operating in a portfolio of contiguous offshore licenses on the UK Continental Shelf, west of Shetland. The area is a proven petroleum basin with large producing oil fields such as Clair, Foinaven, and Schiehallion. Hurricane's licenses are focused on the Rona Ridge, a major NE-SW trending basement feature with a water depth of around 150 meters. The company has made significant discoveries in its acreage, including Lancaster, Whirlwind, Lincoln, and Halifax. Hurricane has drilled eight wells on its acreage since 2009, including five on the Lancaster field. The company is now working towards the first phase of development of its Rona Ridge assets, the Lancaster Early Production System (EPS), which will provide data to improve understanding of the reservoir and be applied across the company's portfolio in further appraisal activity. The EPS involves tying two existing wells back to the Aoka Mizu Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, with objectives to provide long-term production data, commence development of resources in a phased manner, and deliver an acceptable return on investment.Hurricane Energy's 2017 Annual Report highlights a transformative year for the company, with first oil production scheduled for H1 2019. The company has evolved from an exploration and appraisal company to one focused on transitioning towards organic cash generation. Hurricane has established strong working relationships with its Tier 1 contractors, chosen for their industry reputation, technical expertise, and health, safety, and environmental track record. The company has secured major contracts at an opportune moment in the industry cycle and aims to minimize finding and development costs as it further explores, appraises, and develops its Rona Ridge assets. Successful delivery of the Lancaster Early Production System (EPS) is a core component of the Group's remuneration strategy, including the Value Creation Plan (VCP). Hurricane's management is fully aligned with shareholders as the company transitions to becoming cash generative and ultimately monetizing its assets. The company is also working towards becoming compliant with the Financial Reporting Council's UK Corporate Governance Code.Hurricane Energy's expertise lies in identifying and appraising fractured basement reservoirs. Their business model prioritizes health, safety, and the environment at all times, ensuring that they do things the right way without compromising safety, quality, or environmental protection. They are technically driven and focus on exploring, developing, and producing their Rona Ridge assets. The Lancaster EPS provides reservoir knowledge to materially derisk the producibility of their Rona Ridge assets. They aim to minimize finding and development costs to progress assets to a stage where significant uncertainties are removed. Hurricane Energy accepts that maintaining higher license interests than typical for more common reservoir types may be optimal for basement assets. They work with a limited number of appropriately incentivized Tier 1 contractors to minimize operating costs without compromising delivery. Additionally, they engage with the regulator to ensure that their license to operate never becomes a bottleneck, delivering value-focused basement expertise while maintaining a strong focus on health, safety, and the environment, and operating with excellence.Hurricane Energy's Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Robert Trice, highlights the company's progress in the development of the Lancaster field and the Early Production System (EPS). Bluewater's delivery performance has been excellent, with the buoy and mooring installation on track for completion in Q3 2018. The Xmas tree systems are ready for loading onto the rig for the EPS well completions, with operations expected to commence in Q2 2018. The company remains focused on ensuring appraisal and development costs reflect ongoing oil price uncertainty and delivering value throughout the cycle. The EPS project is on time and on budget for first oil in H1 2019, with 75% of pre-first oil capital expenditure locked-in through lump sum contracts with Tier 1 contractors. Hurricane Energy is committed to safe and environmentally responsible operations, with the CEO taking personal responsibility for all environmental matters. The company went through a step change in 2017, booking its first reserves, increasing its 2C Contingent Resources by 450%, and obtaining FDP approval on the first phase of development of its assets. The decision to move to a Premium Listing is yet to be made, but the company is working towards adopting the standards required for such a listing.
