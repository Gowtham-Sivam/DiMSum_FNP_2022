The company's growth since its initial public offering has established it as a world leader in the development of Live Biotherapeutics, with research teams furthering the understanding of the microbiome. The past year has seen the validation of MicroDx, a diagnostic platform for IBS patient stratification, and the GMP certification of the manufacturing facility in León, Spain, which has increased clinical and production capacity. The company's commitment to high standards of governance is emphasized, and the Chairman expresses gratitude to the staff and collaborators for their contributions to the progress made in 2017.
