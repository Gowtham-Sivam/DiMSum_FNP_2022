MJ Gleeson plc reported a milestone year with increased volumes and growth in margins, profit, and cash. Gleeson Homes exceeded 1,000 unit sales for the first time, increasing volumes by 12.1% to 1,013 units and strengthening gross margins on plot sales to 33.0%. This resulted in a 16.9% increase in operating profit to £22.8m. Gleeson Strategic Land increased operating profit by 17.6% to £12.0m by securing attractive residential planning consents and satisfying demand for development sites from medium-sized and large housebuilders. Profit before tax increased by 17.0% to £33.0m, and earnings per share grew by 13.8% to 48.5p. Return on capital employed increased by 220 basis points to 25.4%. Demand for low-cost homes in the North of England was very strong, with long queues forming on launch days at new development sites. Affordability for low-income families buying a Gleeson home remained attractive, and mortgage availability continued to support young first-time buyers. The Government’s White Paper on housing was supportive of Gleeson Homes’ approach to affordable housing and contained proposals that would make it easier for the division to secure planning permissions. Gleeson Strategic Land continued to experience strong demand for consented land in high-value areas in the South of England and attracted multiple bidders for all of its land sales. The Group’s strong performance during the year reflects the dedication and hard work of its employees, with the average number of employees increasing to 370. Reflecting the Group’s strong financial performance and confidence in future prospects, the Board is recommending a final dividend for the year of 17.5 pence per share, giving a total dividend for the year of 24.0 pence per share, an increase of 65.5% compared to the previous year. The Board is confident that the Group has significant scope to grow both revenue and profits in the current year and beyond.In the Chief Executive's Statement, it is reported that Gleeson Homes experienced significant growth in the past year, with operating profits increasing by 16.9% to £22.8m.
