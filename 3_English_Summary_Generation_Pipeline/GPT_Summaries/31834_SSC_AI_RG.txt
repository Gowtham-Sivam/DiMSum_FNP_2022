Plant Impact's 2017 Annual Report highlights the company's investment in R&D and the advances in their pipeline of products despite industry-wide commercial challenges. The past year has seen significant technical innovation from both small companies and industry multinationals in areas such as biostimulants, AgData, plant genetics, and advanced sensing and diagnostic tools. However, the short-term commercial environment in agriculture has been challenging due to a succession of strong harvests depressing commodity prices and creating pressure on growers' profitability. This has led to cost-cutting behavior by farmers and reduced input consumption, resulting in significant channel inventory in markets like Brazil and the United States. The industry is adjusting to these new conditions through consolidation. Plant Impact's business progress reflects these broader sectoral trends, with increased investment in R&D and a step advance in their pipeline of products. In the next two years, the company expects to launch new crop enhancement products for both soybean and wheat, following investments and partnerships for early-stage discovery of new yield-enhancing small molecules.The Chairman's Statement highlights promising discoveries in soybean, wheat, and other major dicot and monocot crops, which are expected to generate significant new revenue in the medium term. Despite a shortfall in grower consumption in the Brazil Veritas business, impacting sales for the 2016/17 financial year and the outlook for the 2017/18 year, the Group has established commercial positions in the United States and Argentina, accounting for more than 90% of the world's soybean production. The Group's Board and management have evolved the company's strategy to reflect the increased flow of development products, moving from a sole focus on exploiting existing products to a future where the R&D platform will significantly broaden the product offering and development challenges.The Chief Executive's Review highlights the successful implementation of the previous strategic plan from 2011 to 2016, which focused on globalizing and integrating products into key sectors of world agriculture.
