Despite challenging trading conditions, Group revenue fell 4% to £9.582m, with recurring revenue growing 6% to £7.474m. Adjusted operating profit dropped to £0.309m, partly due to investment in GatedTalent and a decline in new license sales. The Group raised £0.400m from Directors and PDMRs in the form of a convertible loan note to provide continued funding for GatedTalent. No interim dividend was paid, but a final dividend of 0.5p is proposed, subject to shareholder approval. Both Dillistone Systems and Voyager Software divisions experienced strong demand for products and services in Q1 2018, with Voyager achieving one of its best quarters for new contract wins. Orders for Dillistone Systems' FileFinder product improved significantly, ending the quarter more than 25% up on the same period in 2017. GatedTalent continues to see strong demand, with over 160 firms having signed contracts and the platform generating its first subscription revenue. Long-term revenue growth from GatedTalent will be derived from interactions with executives who register with the service and create a profile. The platform is working well, with the number of profiles growing and expected to increase rapidly over the coming months. The Group has paid dividends throughout its time as a public company and, having ended the year with cash of £1.390m, the Board is pleased to be in a position to pay a dividend of 0.5p per share.
