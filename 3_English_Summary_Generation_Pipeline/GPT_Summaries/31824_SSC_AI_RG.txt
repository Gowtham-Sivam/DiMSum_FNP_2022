Superior Bass Clear Sound Financial Highlights showcases a strong financial performance for the company, with revenue increasing by 39.1% to £110 million, underlying EBITDA rising by 39.9% to £11.5 million, and underlying EBITDA margin slightly improving to 10.5%. The company also saw a significant increase in underlying profit before tax, up by 42.0% to £10.7 million, and a reduction in net debt from £10.0 million to £6.0 million. The company's strategy focuses on four key pillars: growing business with discount retailers, increasing penetration in UK supermarkets, expansion via online channels, and international growth. Despite facing challenges such as cost inflation, currency devaluation, and Brexit uncertainties, the company attributes its strong performance to a range of factors, including a superb product range, an excellent supply chain, a strong customer base, and committed and talented employees.Ultimate Products has made solid operational progress across the business, with a 63.6% growth in online revenue to £4.6 million. The company has continued to develop and expand relationships with its core customer base of UK and European discounters. Cost pressures are coming through from China, where the bulk of the company's products are sourced, due to the strengthening of the Chinese currency and local regulatory changes. However, the company is confident in its ability to manage this due to its experience and strong local presence in Guangzhou. The refurbishment of Ultimate Products' new 240,000 sq ft warehouse at Heron Mill in Oldham has been completed, which is expected to create improved operational efficiencies and additional capacity for future growth. The Group's Board has been strengthened with the appointments of James McCarthy as Chairman, Alan Rigby as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director, and Robbie Bell as Non-Executive Director. The company operates primarily in the branded, value-focused consumer goods sector in the UK, and despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and tougher trading conditions, the Board remains confident that the business will continue to deliver sustainable, long-term growth.
