Refurbishment of older sites, investment

p26 Chief Financial Officer’s Review
(1) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Operating profit before depreciation and amortisation, onerous leases and other non-cash items, impairments and 
reversals of impairments, transaction and reorganisation costs, gains and losses on disposals of assets and subsidiaries and the settlement of the defined 
benefit pension liability. Adjusted EBITDA is considered an accurate and consistent measure of the Group’s trading performance; items adjusted to arrive
