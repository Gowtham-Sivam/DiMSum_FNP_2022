Fresnillo PLC reported significant achievements in 2017, including increased production, managed costs, and an expanded pipeline. The company's silver production increased by 16.6% to 58.7 million ounces, driven by the first full year of operations at San Julián phase I and the start-up of operations at San Julián phase II. Gold production exceeded guidance, mainly due to the full year of operations at San Julián phase I, but decreased by 2.6% year-on-year due to the expected reduction of gold inventories at Herradura.
