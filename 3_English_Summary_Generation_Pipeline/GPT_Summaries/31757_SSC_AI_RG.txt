The Agriculture division supplies branded animal nutrition products to livestock industries and services the UK farming and rural communities through retail stores and fuel businesses. It also manufactures molasses-based feed supplements for ruminant farm animals. The division's products are made in the USA, Germany, and the UK, and are sold through a vast distribution network across the UK, Europe, New Zealand, and North America, with plans to expand to South America in 2018. The Engineering division designs and manufactures bespoke equipment and provides specialist technology and engineering solutions for the nuclear, defense, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. Its product range includes manipulators, robotics, patented technologies, radiation protection, and decontamination, as well as specialist fabrication and precision machining. The division operates from key sites in the UK, Germany, and the USA, and supplies products and services worldwide across Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, and Australasia. Carr's Group's distribution network spans over 50 countries, and its diverse geographic spread and depth of divisional activity provide strength in an increasingly volatile global economic environment.Carr's Group Chairman Chris Holmes reported that the financial year ending 2 September 2017 was challenging due to external factors impacting both the Agriculture and Engineering divisions. Despite this, the year saw significant progress towards achieving the Group's medium-term strategic objectives. The Agriculture division benefited from a recovery in farmgate milk prices, while the Engineering division faced setbacks due to contract delays and poor profitability. The Group invested £24.3 million in expanding its USA feed block operations and growing the Engineering division through acquisitions. Revenue for the year increased by 9.9% to £346.2 million, but operating profit before amortisation of intangible assets and non-recurring items was down 28.5% to £9.3 million. The Group remains focused on delivering its strategic objectives and expects a significant improvement in the Engineering division in the coming year. Trading in the new financial year has started well, and the Group is confident in its outlook.The Agriculture division of Carr's Group faced a challenging year due to lower farming profits in the USA, which impacted sales volumes of feed blocks. However, a recovery in UK Agriculture helped offset this, as farmgate milk prices and farmer confidence improved. In the USA, lower cattle prices affected the feed block business, with sales volumes down 4.1% year on year. A gradual recovery is expected to continue in the current year. The new low moisture feed block plant in Tennessee is expected to be fully operational by the end of December 2017, providing access to new markets across the Eastern and South Eastern states of the USA. UK feed blocks performed well, despite milder spring weather conditions causing a slowdown in the second half. Overall, feed block sales were down 2.1% on last year. The company continues to develop opportunities to expand geographically, with trials in South America and progress in establishing feed block products in New Zealand. Investment in research continues in all territories. The Engineering division had a disappointing year due to a delayed contract in UK Manufacturing, but made significant strategic progress with the acquisition and integration of STABER into the remote handling business and the acquisition of NuVision. The acquisition of NuVision Engineering provides a strong foothold into USA nuclear markets and will enable significant revenue synergies with the Group's existing engineering businesses.
