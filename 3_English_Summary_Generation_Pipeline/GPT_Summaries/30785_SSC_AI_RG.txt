Mears Group focuses on long-term outcomes and positive social, economic, and environmental impact across its two divisions: Housing and Care. In the Housing division, the company carries out 6,000 repairs daily in homes across the UK and made excellent progress in 2017. They have broadened their services in affordable housing, with the acquisition of Omega in 2014 unlocking new housing management opportunities. Mears Group's primary focus remains on organic growth, but they will also look for further acquisitions to reinforce their market-leading position. Their clients are increasingly seeking partners who can operate strategically and operationally across a range of housing services. Mears has extended its core reactive and planned maintenance offering to include housing management to support clients in delivering more integrated solutions. In the Care division, they provide personal care to over 15,000 elderly and disabled people and made good progress in a challenging period. They are focused on improving quality and cost over time and combining services into an integrated approach to achieve better outcomes for users at less overall cost to the public purse. Mears Group offers a comprehensive range of domiciliary care and complex care services, enhanced by the ability to deliver housing adaptations and assistive technology such as telecare. They deliver broad solutions to the independent living challenges faced by elderly people and younger people with physical or mental disabilities.Mears Group's 2017 annual report highlights a challenging year with a focus on long-term business approach and innovation in core markets. Despite a decrease in group revenue to £900.2m and a 7% reduction in profit before tax to £37.1m, the company remains confident in its future opportunities and continues to follow a progressive dividend policy. The report emphasizes Mears Group's strict discipline in bidding for new contract opportunities and its commitment to a well-established leadership team. The company's strategic priorities include reassessing how it guides investors and city analysts, setting expectations based on its 'firm and probable' order book, and appointing an employee director to the Board. Mears Group also aims to improve its gender pay gap and enhance its social value strategy, focusing on creating opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.In 2017, Mears Group secured new contracts below expectations due to reduced traditional repairs and maintenance work and aggressive pricing by competitors. The company will continue to focus on sustainable pricing levels. The market has seen reductions in capital discretionary expenditure levels in the last two years, with social housing landlords focusing more on new-build activity to address the housing shortage. The UK government has announced major commitments to housing, with investment expected to grow over the coming years. Mears has evolved its strategic focus towards Housing Management and Placemaking activities, becoming a leading housing management business in the UK. The company is also building new homes as part of managing the regeneration and delivery of affordable housing for clients. Mears has restructured its Care business, exiting contracts with low pricing and lack of longevity, and will continue to be highly selective going forward. The company needs to communicate more clearly the fundamental role played by Care within its Housing business, as almost half of social housing is occupied by a single resident, with a high proportion of people aged 65 or older or disabled. Mears will increasingly focus its Care bidding activity towards clients where there are opportunities to provide a complete Housing service. The company is currently on site for three schemes involving a combination of funding, build, property management, and care provision, with a good pipeline developing. Mears' dedication to providing clients with first-class service and value remains undiminished, and its unique strategy leaves it better placed than ever to achieve long-term success.
