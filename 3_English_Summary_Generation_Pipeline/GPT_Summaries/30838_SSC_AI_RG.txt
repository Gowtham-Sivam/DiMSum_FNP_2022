ITV's corporate website (www.itvplc.com) offers additional financial results and information for investors. In 2017, ITV achieved a strong performance, with group external revenue of £3,132m (up 2% from 2016) and non-NAR revenue of £2,066m (up 11% from 2016). Adjusted EBITA was £842m (down 5% from 2016), and adjusted EPS was 16.0p (down 6% from 2016). The company saw a 21.7% share of viewing for the ITV Family, a 34% increase in long-form video requests, and a 17% increase in ITV2's 16-34s share of commercial impacts. Popular programs included Good Morning Britain, I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, The Chase, Cold Feet, Broadchurch, Coronation Street, The Voice, American Dad, Family Guy, The Cleveland Show, and Love Island.ITV has reported a challenging year, but one in which the company has made significant progress. Despite a strong operating performance with great on-screen and online viewing, net advertising revenue (NAR) contracted by just under 5% due to political and economic uncertainty. However, the company saw continued growth in non-NAR revenues from sponsorship, digital, and production, both domestically and internationally. ITV's mass commercial audience is at the heart of its offer to viewers and advertisers, and the company has grown its share of television viewing for two years in a row. ITV Studios now produces for over 200 channels in 11 countries around the world, and the company plans to build new revenue streams in the future. With a strong balance sheet, ITV is able to deliver good returns to shareholders while also investing in the future. The Board is proposing a final dividend of 5.28p, which equates to a full-year dividend of 7.8p, up 8%. As ITV works on its next chapter of growth, the company is considering its digital competitors and sees just as many opportunities to seize as threats to ward off. Netflix and Amazon may compete with ITV for viewers, but they also buy the company's programmes and co-produce major new series. ITV is also focusing on company culture and social purpose, taking its contribution to a functioning democracy very seriously as a producer of trusted, sourced national news, regional news, and current affairs in an age of fake news.ITV's Chief Executive, Carolyn McCall, reports that the company's operational performance was strong in 2017 despite a challenging year with economic and political uncertainty impacting the demand for television advertising. ITV saw an increase in share of viewing for the second year in a row, a significant increase in online viewing with over 30% growth, and good revenue growth in the Studios business. The company has a strong consumer proposition and fantastic content that drives mass audiences and key demographics valuable to advertisers. Live television remains the preferred way of watching content, even for younger audiences, and provides a safe, trusted, and transparent environment for advertising. ITV is in good shape, but recognizes the rapidly changing media landscape and increasing competition from traditional broadcasters and new competitors. The company has kicked off a strategy refresh to address these challenges and exploit opportunities in content, advertising, and direct-to-consumer areas. ITV has a solid foundation, strong balance sheet, and healthy cash flows, allowing for flexibility in making strategic decisions for the long-term future while still delivering sustainable returns to shareholders. The company has had a strong start to 2018 with a great schedule of shows and a pipeline of new and returning shows from ITV Studios.
