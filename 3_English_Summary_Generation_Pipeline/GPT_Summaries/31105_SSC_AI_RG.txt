Sumo Digital is one of Europe's largest independent developers of AAA-rated video games, while Atomhawk, acquired in 2017, is a visual design company providing creative services to the entertainment industry. Both companies have developed deep relationships with major computer games publishers, developers, platform manufacturers, and entertainment brands, such as Microsoft, Sony, Sega, Warner Brothers, and Marvel.

Following a secondary management buyout backed by Perwyn LLP in September 2016, the company entered 2017 with a clear plan to deliver strong organic and acquisitive growth. Both objectives were met, and the year culminated with the successful admission of shares in Sumo Group plc to AIM on 21 December 2017. The listing provided a new source of capital to deleverage the balance sheet, raise the company's profile, enable the incentivization of its people, and allow the management to execute its growth strategy. In June 2017, Sumo Group completed the acquisition of Atomhawk Design Limited, a multi-award winning visual design company servicing the video games, film, and visual effects industries. This acquisition extended the range of premium services provided by Sumo Group. Atomhawk had a strong second half, outperforming pre-acquisition expectations. Sumo Digital also successfully launched its first own-IP game, Snake Pass, generating revenue of £1.7m in 2017. The Group intends to continue the selective development of independent games based on original IP. The source of Sumo Group's success is its people, and the company is committed to providing a positive working environment. Since the IPO, the Board has begun a process to enable widescale employee participation in the Group's shares. In summary, Sumo Group made great progress during 2017 and is well-positioned to continue this success in 2018 and beyond.Sumo Group plc, one of Europe's largest independent video game developers, has experienced a momentous year, with the acquisition of Atomhawk Design Limited, a multi award-winning visual design company, and a successful IPO on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in December 2017.
