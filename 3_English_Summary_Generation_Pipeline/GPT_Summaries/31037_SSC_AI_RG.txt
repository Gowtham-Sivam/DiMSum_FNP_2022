Symphony Environmental Technologies, a world leader in controlled-life plastic, has reported a 21.6% increase in revenues to £8.27 million and a 17.8% increase in gross profit to £4.01 million. The company's d2w oxo-biodegradable (OBP) controlled-life masterbatch was the first technology of its kind to be awarded an Eco-Label, distinguishing it from similar products on the market. Symphony's d2w technology is consistent with the principles of “Reduce”, “Re-use” and “Recycle” and is the best technology available for customers, consumers, and the environment. The company has also developed a range of plastic technologies under the d2p (designed to protect) brand, offering extra protection from bacteria, insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, and fire. Additionally, Symphony's d2t tag and trace technologies help protect brand owners from counterfeits and fraud. The company's products are marketed through a network of distributors in nearly 100 countries worldwide.Symphony Environmental Technologies reported a 249.6% increase in profit before tax to £430,000 in 2017, along with £1.03 million cash generated from operations. The company is now in a net cash position and its technologies are gaining commercial traction, with increased political and media coverage. Symphony's d2w oxo-biodegradable plastic technology aligns with governments' core principles of 'reduce, re-use, recycle' and does not cause the accumulation of microplastics in the environment. The technology can also be used in some bio-based plastics that would not otherwise degrade in the open environment. Microplastics are a major concern today, and upgrading ordinary plastics with d2w technology is already being done in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. Symphony has established a strong distribution network with 74 distributors worldwide and aims to increase lobbying and marketing efforts to promote the benefits of its d2w and d2p technologies for the environment and human health. Revenues for the year increased by 21.6% to £8.27 million, with gross profits increasing by 17.8% to £4.01 million, due to increased sales of d2w oxo-biodegradable plastic additives in several markets, particularly in Saudi Arabia where legislation requires the use of oxo-biodegradable technology for everyday plastic items. The overall results highlight the operational gearing of the Group, which effectively removed borrowings from the balance sheet as at year-end and completed a capital-reduction during the second half of the year, resulting in a consolidated retained-earnings position of £67,000.Symphony Environmental Technologies reported a 21.6% increase in group revenues to £8.27 million in 2017, with gross profit margins slightly decreasing to 48.5% from 50.1% in 2016. The majority of revenues were derived from d2w, a type of oxo-biodegradable plastic, and were earned mainly outside of the EU and the United States. Costs increased by 6.9% to £3.30 million due to increased investment in R&D, lobbying, and marketing. The company completed two R&D projects for d2p, including anti-microbial household gloves and plastic water pipes. Symphony was the first company to be awarded the SASO Quality Mark for its d2w oxo-biodegradable additives and to achieve authorized-supplier status for the Saudi Arabian market. The company's strategy for 2018 is to drive sales through increased global communications, social media presence, media campaigns, lobbying, and direct selling.
