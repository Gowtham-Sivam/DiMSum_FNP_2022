Regal Petroleum reported a 65% increase in production for 2017, reaching approximately 2,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), compared to 1,700 boepd in 2016. This growth was largely due to the contributions of the new MEX-109 well and the successful workover of the SV-2 well. The company's revenue for the year reached $35.1 million, with a profit of $2.3 million, compared to a loss of $1.3 million in 2016. Cash generated from operations during the year amounted to $18 million. The average realized gas, condensate, and LPG prices in Ukraine for the year were $241/Mm3, $67/bbl, and $56/bbl, respectively. As of 31 December 2017, Regal Petroleum had cash and cash equivalents of $14.2 million and other short-term investments of $16 million. The company's outlook for 2018 includes a focus on completing geophysical studies, workover of the SV-12 well, planning for a new well, and continued investment in gas processing facilities and pipeline networks at the MEX-GOL and SV fields. At the VAS field, the focus will be on acquiring, processing, and interpreting new 3D seismic data, drilling the VAS-10 well, and investing in gas processing facilities, pipeline networks, and other infrastructure. The 2018 development program is planned to be funded from existing cash resources and operational cash flow.The Chairman's Statement highlights the promising progress made by the Group in 2017, particularly in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV, and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine. Significant improvements in production rates led to a much-improved financial performance. The new MEX-109 well and the SV-2 well nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL and SV fields, while the VAS field continued to produce consistently. Aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields was approximately 2,800 boepd, an increase of nearly 65% over the year. The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine has improved, with better economic outlook, GDP growth, and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange rates. The Ukrainian Government has implemented reforms in the oil and gas industry, including deregulation of the gas supply market and reductions in subsoil tax rates. The Group's financial performance in 2017 resulted in a profit of $2.3 million, mainly due to improved revenues from higher production volumes and hydrocarbon prices. Cash generated from operations during the year was higher at $18.0 million. There were significant changes to the management and Board of Directors of the Company during the year. The outlook for the Group remains positive, with continued progress in the development of its Ukrainian fields and plans for further development activities in 2018.Regal Petroleum has made significant progress in its Ukrainian fields during 2017, with increased development activity at the MEX-GOL and SV fields resulting in the successful MEX-109 and SV-2 wells, boosting production rates. The Group continued working on the subsurface of these fields, using P.D.F. Limited's re-evaluation study to plan further development. The Group also installed additional compression equipment, upgraded gas processing facilities and pipeline networks, and undertook remedial work on existing wells. At the VAS field, planning took place for the acquisition of new 3D seismic data and the drilling of the VAS-10 well, both of which commenced in early 2018. The Group is committed to maintaining high Health, Safety, Environment and Security (HSES) standards, recording 448,618 man-hours without a Lost Time Incident in 2017. Average daily production from the MEX-GOL and SV fields increased in 2017, as did production from the VAS field. The Group plans to continue the development of the MEX-GOL, SV and VAS fields in 2018, including revising the geological model, workover operations, planning for new development wells, and upgrading facilities and infrastructure. Updated assessments of remaining reserves and resources at each field will be commissioned later in 2018. Encouraging new legislation in Ukraine's oil and gas sector, including reductions in subsoil taxes and simplified regulatory procedures, supports the domestic production industry and independent oil and gas producers in the country.
