In 2017, Capco made significant operational progress in its prime central London estates, with Covent Garden now representing over 70% of the Group's portfolio by value. The 18,000 sq ft Lillie Square Clubhouse opened to residents, offering amenities such as a concierge, swimming pool, gymnasium, spa, private dining room, and cinema room. The temporary pop-up high street 'West Brompton Crossing' opened, marking a first for retail and leisure use in the area. Covent Garden saw a successful Christmas launch in partnership with BBC Children in Need, featuring Kylie Minogue and Charlotte Tilbury. New signings included Cora Pearl, Wahlburgers, and luxury travel brand Tumi, with the Shop at Bluebird signing to Floral Street. Capco invested £99 million to extend and consolidate Covent Garden ownership, including the purchase of 15-17 Long Acre and 27b Floral Street. The Beauty Quarter saw the opening of the first global flagship store from Tom Ford and new brand Floral Street Fragrance, as well as cult beauty brand DECIEM. Covent Garden continued to lead the way in concept dining with Avobar, Pancs, and Egg'cellent. Capco signed an agreement with eight institutional investors for £225 million senior unsecured notes.Capco's Chairman, Ian Durant, highlighted the company's progress in 2017, particularly in the Covent Garden area, which now accounts for 72% of the Group's portfolio by value. The Floral Court development is nearing completion, with courtyard and restaurant openings expected in the coming months. However, economic and political uncertainty has impacted the residential market in London, resulting in a decline in the valuation of investments at Earls Court. Despite this, the consented Masterplan remains one of the largest Opportunity Areas in central London, with the ability to evolve with the needs of the Capital. At Earls Court Partnership Limited (ECPL), the final phase of the complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres has been completed, and the first phase of the Lillie Square residential development is nearing completion. In April 2017, Capco completed the sale of the Venues business at a slight premium to net asset value. The company maintains a strong balance sheet, with low leverage, high liquidity, and modest capital commitments. The Directors are proposing a final dividend of 1.0 pence per share, bringing the total dividend for 2017 to 1.5 pence per share. The Board has seen some changes, with Situl Jobanputra promoted to Chief Financial Officer and Charlotte Boyle appointed as a Non-executive Director. The company remains committed to encouraging diversity and inclusiveness across the business. Looking ahead, Capco's strong financial position enables the Group to support its future activities and take advantage of opportunities as they arise, despite broader economic and political uncertainty.In 2017, the total property value of Capital & Counties Properties (Capco) Group declined by 0.9% to £3.5 billion. The valuation of Covent Garden increased by 4.3% to £2.5 billion, driven by ERV growth of 4.6% achieved over the year. Capco's investment in Earls Court Properties declined by 11.8% to £1.0 billion. Covent Garden is continuing to build on its success as a world-class retail and dining destination, with 21 new retail and restaurant brands signed to the estate during the year. Net rental income increased significantly, by 17.8% in absolute terms or 11.3% like-for-like for the year. The ERV of the estate is £105 million, up 4.6% on a like-for-like basis, with positive progress being made towards the ERV target of £125 million by December 2020. Earls Court Properties represents a large-scale strategic opportunity in central London. During the year, ECPL completed the final phase of the complex demolition of the former Earls Court Exhibition Centres in preparation for future development. Capco is in discussions with MOPAC regarding its ongoing occupational requirements at the Empress State Building which may include a lease extension or sale of the building. Capco's outlook for Covent Garden remains positive, with the estate well-placed for continued success and ERV progression towards the target of £125 million by December 2020. The consented Earls Court Masterplan represents one of the most important mixed-use developments in London, with the potential to deliver more housing and optimise this important London scheme. Capco has a clear strategy to deliver long-term value creation for its shareholders from its two prime central London estates, backed by a strong balance sheet with low leverage, high liquidity, and modest capital commitments.
