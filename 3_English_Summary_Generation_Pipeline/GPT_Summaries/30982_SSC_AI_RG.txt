The strategic report and directors' report are consistent with the financial statements and have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. The auditors have nothing to report on other matters required by the Companies Act 2006, such as accounting records, parent company financial statements, directors' remuneration disclosures, and information and explanations required for the audit.In the Chairman's statement, the directors' responsibilities are outlined on page 24. These include the preparation of financial statements, ensuring they provide a true and fair view, and establishing necessary internal controls to prevent material misstatements due to fraud or error. Additionally, directors are responsible for assessing the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing related matters, and using the going concern basis of accounting. This is unless they intend to liquidate the Group or parent Company, cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.
