Xeros Technology Group has made significant progress towards commercializing its water-saving technology across various applications, with meaningful engagement with major industry players worldwide. The group's income increased to £2.3m, while the year-end cash was £25.1m following a £25m capital raise in December 2017. In Cleaning Technologies, the company acquired Marken PPE Restoration and Gloves Inc., with national US coverage expected in 2019. They also launched a domestic washing machine incorporating Xeros technologies at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2018, leading to structured discussions with major OEMs. In Hotel & Lodging, ongoing discussions with two major OEMs are taking place after the launch of the Symphony Project in April 2017, which enables the integration of Xeros technology in OEM-branded machines. The company has also expanded its Forward Channel Partner network, reducing direct sales and service force. In Tanning Technologies, successful scale trials with leading European tanneries have been conducted, with commercial negotiations ongoing and first revenues targeted in 2018. In Textile Technologies, successful lab trials in denim finishing and garment dyeing have been completed, with IP filing protection now allowing for scale trials and development with major garment manufacturers.Battalion Chief Frank Orefice of the Prince William County Department of Fire and Rescue praised Xeros Technology Group's machines for their water and power savings, as well as their excellent customer service. Xeros develops polymer-based technologies that improve the sustainability, performance, and economics of water-intensive processes, significantly reducing water, chemistry, energy, and effluent usage. The company has established that its technologies can deliver benefits in three world-scale industries: cleaning, tanning, and textiles. Xeros is now progressively commercializing applications in these sectors to generate profitable returns, leveraging its intellectual property and know-how with low capital requirements. The company's strategy is to commercialize its technology with partners who have strong international market positions and a strategic intent to deliver increased levels of sustainability. In December, Xeros raised £25m before fees in an oversubscribed placing to accelerate the commercialization of its application portfolio and achieve specific commercial milestones in each of its businesses. The Group expects to raise further funds in 2018 for the execution of specific commercialization strategies.Xeros Technology Group's CEO Mark Nichols reported on the company's progress in the high-performance workwear market, particularly in the US firefighter personal protective equipment (PPE) sector, valued at approximately $330m per year. The company acquired Marken PPE Restoration's operations in Nevada in July 2017, followed by the acquisition of Gloves Inc.'s trade and assets in Atlanta and Miami in March 2018. Xeros aims to have five sites by the end of 2018 and full national coverage in the US by the end of 2019. The company also developed the XDrum technology for domestic laundry, which was unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. Xeros is in discussions with major OEMs for licensing the technology. The company also unveiled its XFiltra technology, a low-cost solution to reduce micro-plastic pollution in washing machines. In the hotel and lodging sector, Xeros is transitioning to a business model that incorporates and sells its proprietary technology in exchange for royalties. The company is working with two major OEMs on testing and validation of Xeros' technology inside their own branded machines. In the tanning industry, Xeros has processed over 2,300 hides in trials and is working on engineering solutions to introduce its polymers into the tanning process. The company is also exploring opportunities in the textiles industry, with successful demonstrations of its technology's capacity to deliver water, chemistry, energy, and effluent reductions. Xeros raised £25m in December 2017 to fund the business through significant commercial milestones by the end of 2018.
