Produce Investments reported a strong performance in the second half of the financial year, with a group operating profit before exceptional items of £8.4m and a profit before tax of £6.6m. The board recommends an increased final dividend of 5.026 pence per share, making a total dividend for the year of 7.466 pence, a rise of 2.0%. The company will continue to grow through strategic acquisitions and organic growth opportunities. The outlook for the year ahead is positive, with improved efficiencies in fresh potato processing sites and anticipated benefits from the implementation of a new ERP system. The group's main concern regarding Brexit is the continued availability of high-quality seasonal labor.Produce Investments' Chief Executive's Report highlights the company's strength in diversity, with diversification, investment, new business gains, and strengthened customer relationships helping to overcome challenges posed by rising raw material costs and intense price competition in the UK retail market. The core potato business, accounting for around 78% of Group revenues, traded successfully through a less stable year, characterized by lower crop yields and higher raw material costs. The company secured increased volumes with a major retail customer for a fixed period of three years through a more collaborative and transparent approach to supply chain management, delivering improved efficiencies for both parties. Sales into non-retail sectors of foodservice and wholesale also showed good growth during the year. The company's growing arm had a successful year, benefiting from higher raw material prices and increased order book in the fresh packing business. The potato processing business continued its recovery, benefiting from a new management structure and an ongoing focus on improved processes and efficiencies. The storage and ripening technology business enjoyed a better year, with recovery in two core markets and new member state chemical approvals within the EU enabling Restrain to achieve a significant increase in its territorial reach. The business remains cash-generative, with an increase in net debt to £28.0m (2016: £18.1m) at the year-end, reflecting the purchase of a packing facility in Jersey for £6.1m (cash), as well as higher stock valuations and increased trade receivables. The diversity of the core business has delivered real benefits during the year, giving increased confidence in the ability to achieve profitable growth in established produce operations in the years ahead.
