EasyJet delivered a robust financial performance this year, with record passenger numbers and revenues growing to more than £5 billion. The airline grew capacity by 8.5% this year, focusing on reaching strong number one positions in Europe's primary airports. Cost control was robust and the company invested in increased resilience which will deliver long-term benefits to easyJet and its customers. The airline's passenger growth was healthy, increasing by 9.7% to 80.2 million, and revenue increased to £5,047 million, an increase of 8.1%. Headline profit before tax was £408 million, despite the impact of £101 million from adverse foreign exchange rates. Reported profit after tax was £305 million. EasyJet achieved a headline return on capital employed of 11.9% as it started to take deliveries of its new fleet order, including its first A320neo aircraft. The company is confident in its ability to deliver sustainable returns to shareholders and in its dividend policy, recommending a dividend of 40.9 pence per share based on its payout policy of 50% of headline profit after tax.In the 2017 financial year, easyJet delivered a robust performance, making good progress in its purposeful growth strategy and disciplined investments to maintain and grow its market-leading positions in Europe's primary, slot-constrained airports. The airline's focused capacity growth of 8.5% includes time-sensitive opportunities in airports such as Amsterdam, which is now full. Over seven million more passengers flew with easyJet this year, representing an increase of 9.7%, at historically high load factors of 92.6%. Total revenue increased by 8.1% to £5,047 million, with revenue per seat broadly flat at £58.23. The airline's disciplined strategy will enable it to be a structural winner within its chosen markets in the European short-haul market. easyJet's focus on rigorous cost control continues to deliver excellent results and supported the investment in operational resilience. Headline cost per seat increased by 2.4% to £53.52 driven by an adverse headline foreign exchange impact of £308 million and the costs of disruption, which remains a major industry challenge. At constant currency, the headline cost per seat decreased by 4.4% as easyJet continued to benefit from its hedged fuel position. The overall cost performance is driven by fuel cost reduction of 19.2% per seat at constant currency, lean initiatives in airports and ground handling, engineering and maintenance savings in the supplier base, and reduced navigation charges. easyJet's strategy is focused on primary airports, serving valuable catchment areas that represent Europe's top markets by GDP. This helps to drive both leisure and business travel. The airline currently holds 18 number one market positions by share of seat capacity and has identified a number of potential targets for the next five years where GDP and passenger volumes are high, and where there is a weak incumbent and/or where there is no clear winner today. easyJet will continue to pursue this strategy with clarity and purpose, expecting that its capacity growth will be targeted at deepening existing number one positions or converting number two positions into number one positions, as well as seeding new number one and two positions. The airline regularly reviews its route network in order to maximise returns and exploit demand opportunities in the market. During the 2017 financial year, easyJet added 79 routes to the network and discontinued 20 routes which either did not meet expected return criteria or became secondary to a more attractive route elsewhere. easyJet remains on track to deliver flat headline cost per seat excluding fuel at constant currency from the 2015 financial year to the 2019 financial year, assuming normal levels of disruption and excluding Air Berlin. The airline is well prepared for the UK's exit from the European Union, having been awarded its Air Operator Certificate (AOC) and airline operating license in Austria.
