Hochschild Mining is a leading underground precious metals company focused on the exploration, mining, processing, and sale of silver and gold in the Americas. In 2017, the company delivered record production figures with 19.1 million attributable ounces of silver and just over 254,000 ounces of gold, marking the fifth consecutive year of output increases. Hochschild currently has three growth projects in southern Peru and northern Chile, with estimated silver equivalent production of 2.7 million ounces for the Crespo project in Peru. The company also has a portfolio of greenfield prospects across the Americas, including assets in Peru, Chile, the US, and Canada. Hochschild aims to invest in mineralized districts with the possibility to grow over time and is excited by the potential to grow its reserves and resources. The company has over 50 years of operating experience in the Americas and is an expert at managing complex underground ore bodies throughout the commodity price cycle and in varying political, economic, and social environments. Hochschild is also targeting earn-in and joint venture arrangements with junior mining companies who have assets in known jurisdictions, satisfying their acquisition criteria of early-stage assets with significant geological upside potential and a clear path to control.Hochschild Mining has grown its production by almost 90% since 2012 while reducing costs by over 40%. The company is focusing on organic growth through brownfield exploration programs at current mines and greenfield prospects across the Americas. In 2017, Hochschild made progress in its brownfield aims, securing surface drilling permits from the Peruvian government and starting drilling campaigns at Arcata, Inmaculada, and San Jose. The company experienced two accidents in 2017, resulting in four fatalities. In response, management has implemented a wide-ranging program to reinforce safety culture, including senior management reviewing high-risk activities, more frequent training, initiatives to motivate and incentivize safe working, and implementing up-to-date safety risk management information systems. Hochschild's focus on environmental performance remains a key priority, and in 2017, the company introduced a new environmental corporate objective as part of its overall Performance Objectives Plan. The outlook for 2018 remains strong, with the company aiming to continue its long-term growth strategy based on low-cost brownfield investment, selective greenfield exploration, and a targeted approach to acquisitions. Safety, operational excellence, and cost control will remain of paramount importance, and the company will continue repaying debt as opportunities arise.Hochschild Mining's Chief Executive, Ignacio Bustamante, reported a strong financial position for the company, with a healthy cash balance of $85 million after redeeming the remaining $295 million of their 7.75% Senior Notes.

Attributable production for 2018 is expected to be 514,000 gold equivalent ounces, with all-in sustaining costs estimated at $960 to $990 per gold equivalent ounce.
