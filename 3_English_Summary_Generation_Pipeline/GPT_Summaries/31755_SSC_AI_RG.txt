The company saw a substantial increase in Sugar profit, benefiting from the sale of cane sugar operations in south China, full ownership of Illovo, and an increase in EU sugar prices. In Grocery, Twinings Ovaltine, ACH in the US, and George Weston Foods in Australia all increased adjusted operating profit, but the UK bread market faced a difficult trading environment. AB Agri continued to expand the value-adding elements of its business, while Ingredients achieved strong profit and margin increases. Primark's selling space expansion continued, with strong increases in market share and a determination to be the best value on the high street. The company expects progress in adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share for the coming year.2017 has been a busy and successful year for our businesses, with a focus on refreshing our grocery brands, advancing seed protection in sugar, promoting innovation in agriculture, embracing technology in ingredients, and enhancing the retail experience. Despite a decline in margin to 10.4%, Primark has continued to seek better ways of delivering value to customers through store design, stock availability, and on-trend fashion. The Primark website and social media have played an increasingly important role in driving product awareness and footfall in stores. In the coming year, Primark plans to expand its selling space across all countries of operation with a strong program of new store openings. The implications of the EU referendum for the group should be considered in the context of our diverse operations and geographical footprint, as well as our discrete Primark supply chains for the UK and Eurozone. Changes in legislation and trade agreements provide significant opportunities for the food industry to replace imported food and build export markets, potentially benefiting our group. We are engaged with several UK Government departments to ensure that the full range of opportunities and risks are recognized. We welcome the Government's commitment to not increase tariffs on exports from least developed countries to the UK after Brexit, benefiting both UK consumers and trade with these countries. We also share concerns about the risk of abrupt changes to the UK's customs procedures and welcome the Government's intention to have a transition period beyond March 2019 to implement necessary systems and processes.
