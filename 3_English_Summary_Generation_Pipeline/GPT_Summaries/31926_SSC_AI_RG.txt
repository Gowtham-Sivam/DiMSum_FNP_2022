The company operates in four main sectors: Property, Residential, Construction, and Services. In Property, Kier is a top 3 trader developer in the UK with a non-speculative focus and a 10-year visibility of pipeline. Their residential business, Kier Living, offers mixed tenure housing and has national coverage. The Construction sector comprises UK building and infrastructure, as well as international construction, with a focus on education and health markets. Services include strategic and local authority highways maintenance, utilities, housing maintenance, facilities management, and environmental services. Kier Group has a strong market position, long-term client relationships, specialist expertise, efficient capital and resource model, and robust financials. Their unique investment proposition combines performance with established client relationships and capital recycling.Kier Group's Chairman, Philip Cox, reported good progress against the company's Vision 2020 strategy, with group revenue increasing by 5% to £4.27bn and underlying operating profit increasing by 3% to £146m for the year ended 30 June 2017. Underlying profit before tax increased by 8% to £126m, while reported profit before tax of £26m includes non-underlying items. The Group's net debt at 30 June 2017 was £110m, maintaining a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than 1x. The Board recommended a full-year dividend of 67.5 pence per share, up 5%, reflecting confidence in the Group's prospects. The acquisition of McNicholas Limited after the year-end strengthens Kier's presence in the utilities and infrastructure services market. Despite Brexit uncertainties, Kier has a strong position in key sectors and its breadth of capabilities positions it well to address clients' needs. The Group's Construction and Services order books of £9.5bn, together with property development and residential pipelines, provide good long-term visibility of future work, giving confidence in achieving Vision 2020 strategic targets.In 2017, Kier Group made significant progress in its core markets of building, infrastructure, and housing. The company's two-year portfolio simplification program has allowed it to strengthen its market-leading positions and improve efficiency, providing a platform for growth. Kier's performance in 2017 saw organic growth in revenue and operating profit across the Group, with a net debt position at the lower end of market forecasts. The Construction and Services order book was approximately £9.5bn, securing around 90% of work for 2018. The Residential housing business performed well, and the Property division pipeline expanded to around £1.4bn. The portfolio simplification program involved closing operations in territories with declining business prospects and selling businesses not aligned with the Group's strategic direction. As a result, Kier has emerged as a more agile, efficient, and focused organization with a growth trajectory ahead. The company's unique strength lies in its ability to offer a wide range of services and operational flexibility, allowing it to invest, build, and maintain assets and projects for clients. Kier's strategy is focused on organic growth, seeking complementary merger and acquisition opportunities to expand its offering. Despite Brexit and political uncertainty in the UK, Kier's specialization in key focus areas for the UK Government, such as housing and infrastructure, and its delivery of essential everyday services, allows it to maintain operational stability and pursue growth.
