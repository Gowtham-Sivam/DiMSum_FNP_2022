In 2017, ValiRx made significant progress in their research and ambition to find more effective cancer treatments. Their core clinical products, VAL201 and VAL401, reached significant value inflection points, offering potential investors an investable proposition and an attractive offering to joint venture partners. The company successfully completed the VAL401 Phase II clinical study in patients with late-stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. They also made consistent progress with their VAL201 therapeutic, receiving approval from the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the Research Ethics Committee to substantially expand and accelerate the trial for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. The integration of their clinical in-house team with a board of oncologists and clinical nurse specialists has provided valuable insight into how they can more rapidly bring safe, efficacious, therapeutic, and palliative medicines to cancer patients. Additionally, the company has progressed their pre-clinical pipeline, which currently consists of VAL301, derived from the formulation of VAL201, and VAL101, derived from their GeneICE technology platform. VAL401 and VAL201 have received several major patent grants, and their IP portfolio now covers all major areas worldwide.ValiRx's Chairman, Oliver de Giorgio-Miller, reported significant progress in the company's research and development capabilities in personalized and precision medicine. In 2017, the company's first therapeutic, VAL201, demonstrated high safety and tolerability, as well as preliminary therapeutic activity in clinical studies. The company also advanced the reformulation of VAL201 into VAL301 for the treatment of Endometriosis, a painful and debilitating gynecological condition with high unmet clinical needs. A noteworthy achievement was the successful completion of the VAL401 Phase II clinical study in patients with late-stage non-small cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer. The data analyzed by Ariana, a leading digital health company, advocated the therapeutic potential for VAL401 as a single therapy in treating this cancer. ValiRx also received notification that a further method-of-treatment patent has been granted by the US Patent Office covering the use of VAL201 in the treatment of prostate cancer. The company's financial results showed a total comprehensive loss for the year ended 31 December 2017 of £3,019,684, a decrease of 36.40% on the previous year (2016: £4,748,003) and a loss per share from continuing operations of 1.90p (2016: Loss 8.54p). The marked reduction in loss was attributable to a decrease in clinical trial expenditure as the manufacturing costs for both of the investigational medicinal products, VAL201 and VAL401, that were incurred for their respective trials, were borne during 2016. In conclusion, the Chairman believes the Group has seen substantive and encouraging developments across its portfolio during the period to December 2017, with the progress of core clinical products VAL201 and VAL401 reaching significant value inflection points, offering potential investors an investable proposition and an attractive offering to joint venture partners.In 2017, ValiRx saw significant progress in its two clinical compounds, VAL401 and VAL201. VAL401, a reformulation of Risperidone, completed its Phase II trial for non-small cell lung cancer, showing a statistically significant improvement in overall patient survival. The compound also demonstrated potential for treating late-stage cancer patients in the palliative arena and for use in combination with traditional chemotherapies and immune-oncology treatments. The lung cancer market is projected to be valued at USD 7.9 billion in 2020, and ValiRx is in discussions with large pharmaceutical companies to fill their pipelines in this area. VAL201, a potential breakthrough treatment for advanced prostate cancer, showed excellent safety, tolerability, and early efficacy in clinical trials. In December 2017, ValiRx received MHRA approval to enhance its VAL201 dose escalation and expansion clinical trial, allowing for a substantial increase in the amount and frequency of VAL201 administered to patients. This is expected to speed up the human development of the treatment, saving both time and money. ValiRx's preclinical developments of VAL301 and VAL101 are also progressing with encouraging results, and the company's patent portfolio has been strengthened with grants for VAL401 and VAL201 in major territories. These advances make ValiRx and its compounds more attractive to potential partners and address unmet needs in the market.
