The company completed two acquisitions, Breathing Buildings and VoltAir System, which diversified the Group's market exposure. The integration of National Ventilation and Airtech brands was completed, resulting in a significant increase in operating margins. The Group delivered organic revenue growth of 2.1% on a constant currency basis, despite weakness in the Residential Public Repair, Maintenance and Improvement (RMI) market and a small decline in the UK commercial sector. Torin-Sifan, after a decline in revenue in the first half of the financial year, delivered a full year organic revenue growth of 2.8% on a constant currency basis. The CEO highlighted the company's focus on three strategic pillars: organic growth in core markets, growth through disciplined and value-adding acquisition strategy, and further development of Torin-Sifan's range to build customer preference and loyalty. The outlook for the new financial year is positive, with organic growth ahead of the prior year and the Board confident of delivering good progress.
