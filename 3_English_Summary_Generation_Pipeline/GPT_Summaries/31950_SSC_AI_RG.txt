Diurnal Group has reported an operating loss of £12.1m for 2017, up from £7m in 2016, due to increased investment to support the group's anticipated development. The company's cash and cash equivalents and held to maturity financial assets were £19.9m, down from £30.1m in 2016. Diurnal successfully met the primary endpoint in the European Phase III Infacort registration trial in paediatric AI and submitted Infacort paediatric use marketing authorisation (PUMA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The first patient was dosed in a food matrix compatibility study, which is part of the US Phase III registration package for Infacort. The company completed the first phase of establishing its European commercial infrastructure and implemented the commercial supply chain for Infacort. Additionally, significant progress was made in the European Phase III trial of Chronocort in CAH, with over 75% of patients enrolled. Post-period highlights include submitting responses to the EMA's 'Day 120 questions' following the review of the Infacort PUMA package and submitting a proposed Phase III pivotal US registration study design and supporting data package for Chronocort to the US Food and Drug Administration.Diurnal Group has made significant progress towards becoming a world-leading endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company, delivering key milestones towards first commercial revenues. The company aims to develop and commercialize products to address unmet patient needs in chronic endocrine diseases, representing a multi-billion dollar combined market opportunity. Diurnal has continued to make significant clinical development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, Infacort® and Chronocort®, targeting indications of cortisol deficiency. Infacort® has completed a Phase III clinical trial and has been submitted for marketing authorization in Europe, while Chronocort® is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial for Europe. The Group anticipates receiving market authorization for Infacort® in Europe towards the end of 2017. Diurnal also continues to invest in its earlier-stage pipeline, making progress with its oral native testosterone product, as well as programs in Cushing's Disease and hypothyroidism. The company has strengthened its Board with the appointment of Richard Bungay as Chief Financial Officer and remains focused on maintaining a strong system of internal controls and appropriate risk management systems.Diurnal Group is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on chronic endocrine diseases. Their late-stage 'Adrenal Franchise' includes Infacort, an immediate-release hydrocortisone preparation for children with Adrenal Insufficiency, which completed a European Phase III clinical trial in 2016 and is expected to receive market authorization in late 2017. Chronocort, a modified-release hydrocortisone preparation for adult patients with Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia, began a European Phase III clinical trial in 2016 and is set to commence a US Phase III clinical trial by the end of 2017. Diurnal's early-stage pipeline includes T3 modified-release, a preparation of T3 hormone for hypothyroidism patients, with formulation feasibility work planned for 2018; Rheumacort, a modified-release hydrocortisone preparation for inflammatory diseases, with a Phase II proof-of-concept study planned for 2018; siRNA, a short interfering RNA oligonucleotide therapy for Cushing's syndrome patients, with in vivo proof-of-principle experiments planned for 2018; and Native Oral Testosterone (DITEST), a testosterone replacement treatment for hypogonadism patients, which began a proof of concept study in 2016.Diurnal Group has made significant progress in the financial year to 30 June 2017, building on the momentum from its initial public offering (IPO) in December 2015. The company has successfully completed the registration study and regulatory submission of Infacort® in Europe, with recommendation for approval anticipated towards the end of 2017. First revenues are expected in 2018 as the Group builds out its commercial capability in Europe. Diurnal believes it has an opportunity to become one of the few UK biotechnology companies to successfully take a product from concept to commercialization. The company's strategy of developing novel products using well-characterized active ingredients to meet significant unmet medical needs offers a lower risk approach than the development of new chemical or biological entities. Diurnal's product candidates are protected by a wholly-owned patent portfolio, benefiting from granted or pending patents in key jurisdictions, along with strong protection through Orphan Drug designations. The Group is well positioned for its anticipated transformation into a fully integrated, world-leading, endocrinology-focused specialty pharma company.
