Metal Bulletin launched a Shanghai copper price three years ago in response to a story about fictitious copper and aluminium sales that caused the price for Shanghai bonded-warehouse copper to drop by a fifth. This price has since become an important benchmark, leading the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to launch a derivative contract that will be settled using Metal Bulletin's price. This will provide the market with a hedging option for copper sold to China, the world's largest consumer of the commodity, and generate additional revenues for the price-reporting business.
