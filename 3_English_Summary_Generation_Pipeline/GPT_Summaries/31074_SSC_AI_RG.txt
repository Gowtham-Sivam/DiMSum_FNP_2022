Circassia Pharmaceuticals made significant progress in 2017, achieving growth after major changes to its business the prior year. The company halted its investment in the allergy field and focused on building its respiratory franchise, transitioning into a highly commercially focused business with a broad sales infrastructure and a portfolio of marketed products. In 2016, the Board reconfirmed Circassia's strategy of building a self-sustaining specialty pharmaceutical company focused on respiratory disease. The company expanded its US commercial platform to increase revenues from its in-house NIOX® products and attract in-licensing, partnering, and acquisition opportunities. This growth strategy proved successful, and in 2017 Circassia established a flagship US partnership with AstraZeneca for the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) products Tudorza® and Duaklir®. Circassia plans to build on this momentum by deploying a refocused investment strategy pursuing a similar approach in China. Under its refocused strategy, Circassia intends to reallocate its resources and complete its transformation into a commercial business. The Company plans to fund commercial investment through a combination of growing revenues, corporate cost containment, and reductions in research and development (R&D) expenditure by seeking to out-license/partner its respiratory pipeline of directly substitutable generic products and novel formulations of currently approved drugs. Circassia will continue to invest in its R&D, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, quality, and regulatory activities supporting its US COPD products and global NIOX® franchise. During the past year, Circassia has made significant strategic progress, and with its refocused investment strategy, the Company plans to complete its transition into a commercial business in the coming months. As a result, in a period of just two years, Circassia will have transformed from an R&D-focused organization into a growing commercial business with increasing revenues and global commercial infrastructure. The Company's revenues doubled in 2017 and are positioned for further growth. During the coming year, Circassia plans to drive sales in its NIOX® franchise, building on positive new recommendations issued by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The Company will also benefit from a full year's revenues from its Tudorza® collaboration. In the coming year, Circassia anticipates exercising its option to acquire the full US commercial rights to Tudorza® from AstraZeneca and looks forward to its partner filing for Duaklir® approval. During 2018, Circassia intends to leverage the ongoing momentum in its business, continuing its transition towards self-sufficiency. It plans to extend its commercial platform in China and seek additional third-party products to commercialize through its specialty infrastructure. Having undergone a period of difficult decisions and great change, Circassia's ambition to build a world-class global specialty pharmaceutical company, creating significant shareholder value, remains stronger than ever.In 2017, Circassia underwent a major transformation, making significant progress towards becoming a commercially-focused specialty respiratory business. The company's NIOX® asthma management products continued to grow, and a major US collaboration with AstraZeneca was established for COPD products Tudorza® and Duaklir®. Circassia's revenues doubled in 2017, and cost containment measures delivered tangible savings, driving the business towards self-sustainability. The company plans to maintain this progress in 2018 by refocusing its investment strategy to support the ongoing expansion of its commercial platform, particularly in China, while reducing R&D and corporate costs. Circassia anticipates ongoing significant revenue growth from its commercial portfolio, plans to continue expanding its commercial platform, and expects to fund any payment to AstraZeneca for the full US commercial rights to Tudorza® through third-party financing or a vendor loan. With robust sales growth, an exciting product portfolio, and an expanding commercial presence, Circassia is highly positive about the coming year.
