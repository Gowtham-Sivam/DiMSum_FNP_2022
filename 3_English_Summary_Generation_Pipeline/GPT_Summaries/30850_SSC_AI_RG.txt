In 2017, Jupiter Fund Management maintained strong investment outperformance after all fees, with 81% of their mutual fund assets under management (AUM) outperforming the median over three years. This contributed to net inflows of £5.5bn and an increase in AUM of 24% to £50.2bn. The growth in AUM was the primary driver of the 19% increase in net management fees to £392.4m, enabling continued investment in the business. Jupiter's efficient platform and operating model helped turn revenue growth into underlying earnings per share of 34.2p, up 16%. Other financial highlights include basic earnings per share up 14% to 34.5p and profit before tax up 13% to £192.9m. The total dividends for the year were 32.6p per share, including ordinary dividends of 17.1p (up 16%) and a special dividend of 15.5p (2016: 12.5p). Jupiter's diversification strategy, underpinned by a resilient balance sheet, allowed for healthy returns to shareholders. The company aims to deliver value for money to clients through active fund management that delivers long-term investment outperformance, after all fees. Investment outperformance helps grow AUM, increasing revenues and profits, allowing for investment in continued growth as well as rewarding employees and adding value for shareholders through ordinary and special dividends and capital appreciation. Jupiter's people and culture are key to their success, with talented individuals free to pursue their own investment styles, focusing on good stewardship. The company has followed a successful strategy of diversifying by geography, client type, and product while maintaining and investing in an efficient operating platform, resulting in a more resilient business and providing a broader range of growth opportunities for the years ahead.Jupiter Fund Management's CEO, Maarten Slendebroek, reported a strong year for the company in 2017, with improvements in three-year investment performance, net inflows, and progress on strategic projects. The percentage of mutual fund AUM with above-median performance increased from 75% in 2016 to 81% in 2017. Net inflows reached £5.5bn, a significant increase from £1.0bn in 2016, reflecting the success of the company's diversification strategy. This growth, along with investment outperformance and market movements, led to a 24% increase in AUM, which in turn supported the company's financial performance. Net revenues totaled £409.5m, up 17% from 2016, and statutory profit before tax rose by 13% to £192.9m. The company's strategic progress was recognized in 2017 when Investment Week named Jupiter 'Global Group of the Year'. All regions contributed to net inflows in 2017, with international distribution providing 75% of net inflows without requiring significant additional resources. Fixed income AUM now stands at £13.4bn, or 27% of the total for the Group, contributing towards the strategic goal of diversifying across different product types. The company launched two emerging market debt funds and the Emerging & Frontier Income Trust in 2017, underlining Jupiter's growing expertise and reputation in emerging markets. The company also sees alternatives as an exciting area of growth and launched the Global Levered Absolute Return Fund to build on the success of the Absolute Return Fund. Jupiter will continue to invest in enhancing its systems and processes to prepare effectively for new regulations over the coming years. Despite disruptions and uncertainties, the resilience of Jupiter's current operating model and balance sheet strength mean that the company is well placed to continue its growth trajectory and look for new areas of opportunity.
