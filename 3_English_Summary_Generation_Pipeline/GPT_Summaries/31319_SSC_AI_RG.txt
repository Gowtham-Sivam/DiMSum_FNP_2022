This was aided by the acquisition of The Creative Engagement Group (TCEG). The company's focus on operational efficiencies and the elimination of loss-making agencies, combined with strong organic growth from the Healthcare division, resulted in a 20% growth in headline profit. The restructuring of the Group into four principal divisions following the acquisition of TCEG has provided a better balance to the reporting structure and greater insight into the Group's performance. The three Healthcare-focused divisions experienced buoyant trading, led by Evoke and ApotheCom. TCEG has performed well in its first six months, now fully integrated within the Group and increasingly engaged in joint new business with other Group agencies. In the Communications division, Grayling has returned to profitability following its restructuring, with a strong performance from its UK operation. Red has had a good year despite some client attrition, while Citigate Dewe Rogerson had a solid year despite difficult market conditions in the UK and Asia. Huntsworth has real momentum as all agencies focus on what is of most value to their clients, and the company enters 2018 with good trading momentum and confidence for the year ahead.Chief Executive discusses evolving business model and strategy introduction.
