easyHotel has experienced significant growth, with strong trading across its existing estate and newly opened hotels, resulting in increased total systems sales and like-for-like revenues. The company continues to strategically target selected locations for its owned and franchised hotels, while also optimizing the value of existing assets through investments in revenue management systems and improving customers' online booking experience. The funds raised from equity capital and bank debt have allowed easyHotel to commit to a strong pipeline of new sites, with recent acquisitions substantially committing those funds. New owned hotels have opened in Birmingham and Manchester, with further projects in progress in various locations, including Barcelona, Leeds, and Oxford. The company's new room design has led to above-budget performance in newly launched hotels, and a program to refresh legacy assets is expected to have a similar positive impact on revenues. The Board recommends a final dividend of 0.22p per share, subject to shareholder approval.The Chairman's statement highlights strong trading across existing hotels and continued outperformance against competitors. Excellent progress has been achieved across all areas of the business, with five new hotels opened and trading strongly. There has been a positive customer reaction to the stylish new easyHotel format, and a significantly accelerated pipeline is in place to deliver long-term shareholder value. Total system sales grew by 39.2% to £29.7m, with company revenues increasing by 39.7% to £8.4m. This was achieved through like-for-like owned and franchised hotel sales growth of 9.8%, as well as the opening of new owned hotels in Birmingham and Manchester, and franchised hotels in Brussels, Amsterdam Arena, and Amsterdam Zaandam. Occupancy for all owned and franchised hotels was 79.7% (2016: 76.2%). The five hotels opened in the new brand style have all traded very strongly since opening, with a combined occupancy in excess of 85%. The strong sales performance led to a 48.3% increase in adjusted EBITDA to £2.30m (2016: £1.55m). Owned hotels continued to win market share with revenue growing by 13.7% on a like-for-like basis. The new booking engine and revenue management system rollout, together with selling an allocation of rooms via selected online travel agencies (OTAs), resulted in owned hotels significantly outperforming their competitive set (as measured by STR) throughout the year. Like-for-like revenue at franchised hotels increased by 8.6% during the financial year, with total currency adjusted sales increasing by 32.2%. The UK hotel market performed strongly in 2017, with Sterling’s weakness resulting in an increase in staycations and inbound tourism. The European hotel market also continued to perform strongly during the financial year. The Board remains confident that despite any uncertainties surrounding Brexit negotiations, the easyHotel brand will continue to outperform its hotel sector as consumers seek out the best value for money.The Chief Executive Officer's review highlights the company's plan to deliver a 15% unlevered blended ROCE at the Group level, with 921 owned rooms under development. The Group's asset-backed balance sheet remains strong, but with the current development pipeline, they can only finance one more owned hotel. The Board is considering financing options, including new equity and debt, to fund further growth opportunities. There are 1,798 franchised rooms under development, with hotel openings in Lisbon, Bernkastel-Kues, Belfast, The Hague, Maastricht, and Reading in 2018, and Bur Dubai, Istanbul, Iran, and Sri Lanka beyond 2018. The company has extended its pipeline with over 2,300 owned and leased rooms under negotiation, as well as a further 1,300 franchised rooms. The potential for franchised development outside the UK and Europe is yet to be fully assessed, but recent activity and enquiries in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia indicate strong demand for the easyHotel brand. The company is focused on building its capability, enhancing its organization and culture, leveraging the recognized and trusted “easy” brand, and improving customer recommendation. The company is also investing in technology, with a new booking engine, website, mobile app, and automated check-in kiosks to improve the customer journey. The company's values emphasize providing teams with career opportunities, customers with a super budget stay, and shareholders with a great return on investment.
