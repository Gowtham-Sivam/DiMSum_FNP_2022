Idox plc's Chairman's Statement highlights a year of change and contrasting performance for the company. Despite a promising start, the company faced setbacks in the second half of the year, impacting reported profits. These setbacks included customer disruption following the UK General Election, delayed contract sign-offs, and the identification of nine contracts where revenue should not be recognized in the results. However, the year-end audit did not reveal any additional material problems or increase the size of the related adjustment. The company's finance team is commended for their diligence and integrity. The statement also discusses changes in the Board, with Richard Kellett-Clarke stepping in as Interim Chief Executive following Andrew Riley's illness, and Peter Lilley stepping down from his role as Senior Non-Executive Director. Idox grew revenues by 16%, but adjusted EBITDA declined by 13.9% due to one-off issues. The company completed two acquisitions during the financial year, 6PM and Halarose, both in line with its strategy and contributing to the financial results. The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.655p, bringing the total for the year to 1.04p, an increase of 4%. Despite the disappointing results, the Chairman expresses confidence in the Group's future prospects, citing its strong market position, sound balance sheet, and multiple opportunities for growth.Idox's Chief Executive Richard Kellett-Clarke acknowledges the failure to achieve year-end numbers as a result of a perfect storm of issues, including complex acquisitions, a time-consuming capital raise, and a general election year. To address these issues, the company has focused on five core changes: full integration of the last four acquisitions, targeting Â£7m of cost savings, reviewing Group pricing and revenue recognition policy, accelerating digital, mobile, and web technology strategy, and improving processes to reduce administration and improve cash collection. Kellett-Clarke is confident that the Group is well positioned for the current financial year, driven by new contract momentum, management and organizational changes, cost savings, and full-year contributions from the 2017 acquisitions. The Group's strategy remains focused on the wider public sector, with plans to accelerate international ambitions and expand the UK elections market outside the UK.
