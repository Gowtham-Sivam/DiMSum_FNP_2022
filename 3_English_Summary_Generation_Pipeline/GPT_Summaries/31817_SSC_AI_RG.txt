Nanoco Group's 2017 annual report highlights a hybrid commercial model in display, with direct sales of their own manufactured product and multiple non-exclusive licenses. The company has increased its manufacturing capacity ten-fold at Runcorn and reduced product costs, receiving its first commercial sales orders. They have a substantial pipeline of commercial opportunities, focusing on television and monitor projects with near-term potential. Nanoco signed a development and commercialization deal with Kyulux for CFQD/OLED hybrid display. The company decided to divest from solar and is in the process of doing so. They were awarded a new grant for work on pancreatic cancer and made significant progress in medical applications research. Their revenue and other operating income for the year was £1.6 million, with a loss after tax of £9.1 million. Cash and cash on deposit at the end of July 2017 was £5.7 million. Post balance sheet events include net proceeds of £8 million from a placing in November 2017, which significantly strengthened their cash balance and removed immediate going concern issues. They also had a successful exhibition of televisions containing Nanoco Fine Color Film at Touch Taiwan and finalized a Commercial Supply and License Agreement with a US corporation in the field of medical devices for the treatment of pain, soft tissue injury, and dermatological conditions.Nanoco Group is a pioneer and world leader in the development and production of cadmium-free quantum dots (CFQDs), with an extensive patent portfolio of around 600 patents granted or pending. The company focuses on large addressable markets and has a scalable platform technology with multiple markets and product applications. Its main focus to date is the display market, with a hybrid IP licensing and material supply model offering multiple routes to market. Nanoco's lighting division specializes in direct sales of its own manufactured products, with a focus on horticulture and phototherapy. The company also has a solar division, working on printable CIGS solar cells, and a life sciences division, focusing on cancer imaging, diagnostics, and therapy. Nanoco is headquartered in Manchester, UK, with additional business development offices in the USA, Korea, and Japan.Nanoco's Chairman, Dr. Christopher Richards, has reported slower than anticipated adoption of the company's cadmium-free quantum dots (CFQDs) in the display industry for the year to 31 July 2017. However, significant progress has been made in developing demand for CFQDs, with an increasing number of manufacturers now producing demonstration displays incorporating Nanoco's technology. The company is also making good progress in life sciences and specialized lighting. The slower progress in display and the company's funding horizon have both negatively impacted the company's share price, but a recent equity placing has alleviated liquidity concerns. Nanoco has a compelling go-to-market strategy, partnering with Taiwan's Wah Hong Industrial Corporation, The Dow Chemical Company, and Merck KGaA. The European Commission's ban on cadmium in displays from 31 October 2019 is expected to accelerate adoption of Nanoco's technology. The company has also made progress in life sciences and specialized lighting, winning an Innovate UK grant and a commercial supply and license agreement from a US medical device company.Nanoco Group has made significant changes in its approach to business, resulting in increased confidence in future success. The company has implemented an enhanced go-to-market strategy, invested in manufacturing capability, and received its first commercial sales orders. The evolution in marketing strategy for the display industry has allowed the Group to accelerate the roll-out of its technology, moving from an exclusive licensing model with Dow to a hybrid model. Nanoco has also developed its own channel to market for product manufactured at its Runcorn facility in the UK, and sold via its Taiwanese partner Wah Hong. The company now has a three-pronged go-to-market strategy to capitalize on the expected demand for its CFQDs. New production methods have achieved a substantial reduction in costs while increasing the productivity of installed capacity. Nanoco's technology was featured at Touch Taiwan 2017, further validating the growing interest in state-of-the-art TVs and monitors incorporating CFQDs to enhance color performance. The company continues to make solid progress in the commercialization of CFQDs and expects to announce further progress from its healthy pipeline of projects.
