C4X Discovery Holdings aims to become the world's most productive Drug Discovery Engine by supplying the pharmaceutical industry with a sustainable source of commercially attractive drug assets. The company focuses on the early discovery of novel therapeutic targets for high-value disease areas and generates new drug molecules against these targets. C4X Discovery's sustainability will be driven by licensing its assets to the pharmaceutical industry and using the revenue generated to drive its engine harder. The company's proprietary suite of drug discovery technologies, including Taxonomy3®, Conformetrix, and MolPlex, combined with its highly experienced and uniquely trained scientific team, positions it to achieve its goal. Taxonomy3® is used to analyze complex genetic datasets, identifying and characterizing defined patient groups and previously unknown genetic linkages and interactions between genes and biological pathways in a broad range of diseases. The company's pioneering drug design technology comprises both Conformetrix and MolPlex, which enable C4XD to enter novel chemical space and rapidly gain knowledge about the bioactive form required for a successful drug, allowing the design of highly potent and selective molecules.C4XD aims to become self-sustaining by capitalizing on the pharmaceutical industry's growing demand for high-quality, early-stage drug candidates. The company focuses on building a commercial function that constantly monitors the landscape for licensing opportunities in areas of high unmet medical need that are commercially attractive. By generating long-term partnerships with licensors, C4XD plans to reinvest revenue from early-stage licensing deals into its Drug Discovery Engine to maximize shareholder value. The company is on track to complete its first early-stage licensing deal in early 2018 and will continue to seek opportunities to build alliances with organizations that have complementary capabilities. C4XD's strengths include a fast, cost-effective novel candidate discovery process, a diversified multi-disease portfolio, focused investment on high-value activities, long-term alliance revenue from partners, a suite of cutting-edge proprietary technologies, a highly experienced scientific team, an industry-leading management team and board, and a proactive commercial capability.C4XD's CEO, Clive Dix, highlights the company's progress in implementing its vision, including commercialization efforts, strategic alliances, successful fundraises, and building its discovery portfolio. The company expects to complete its first commercial deal within 12 months of the fundraise in March 2017, with its lead program, Orexin-1, targeting addiction treatment. C4XD has entered late-stage commercial discussions and has seen high levels of pre-clinical partnering interest. The company has also formed a risk-sharing strategic collaboration with Evotec AG, which will expand its ability to generate commercially attractive pre-clinical assets. C4XD has successfully raised funds in September 2016 and March 2017, bringing in new investors and providing working capital for operations. The company continues to build its portfolio and invest in core discovery activities, with key drug discovery programs in addiction and inflammation advancing. C4XD's strategy aims to deliver value for shareholders, focusing on securing deal revenue, progressing discovery candidates to pre-clinical development and commercialization, and identifying novel drug targets.
