The company focused on delivering its strategic objectives, with the i newspaper showing strong performance and adjusted EBITDA in line with expectations. Statutory revenue decreased from £222.7 million in 2016 to £201.6 million in 2017, partly due to the sale of 13 titles in the East Midlands. The Group reported a loss of £78.6 million in 2017, compared to £247.3 million in 2016, resulting from non-cash asset impairment charges, mark-to-market on the bond, and exceptional costs. Adjusted operating profit was £33.1 million, down from £36.9 million in 2016, reflecting the challenging trading environment. The company's strategic review of financing options for the £220 million senior secured notes due on 1 June 2019 is ongoing, with the Board satisfied with the continued support of major stakeholders during the review process. The management team remains focused on key strategic aims, including growing the Group's overall audience, continuing the successful growth of the i newspaper and inews.co.uk, and maintaining profitability while improving customer, reader, and staff satisfaction. The company is committed to the Independent Press Standards Organisation and is concerned about the potential introduction of s.40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which could make newspaper publishers liable for the costs of dealing with complaints even if they are dismissed or have no merit. Johnston Press is also participating in the recruitment of 31 local democracy reporters as part of an innovative deal between the News Media Association and the BBC. The company does not have distributable reserves and no ordinary or preference dividend is proposed for the year. The Board is committed to encouraging diversity within its membership and has adopted a written diversity policy. The outlook for 2018 remains challenging, with the management team focused on delivering strategic objectives, investing in digital growth, and looking for ways to reduce costs in the face of declining print revenue.
