In 2017, accesso Technology Group experienced growth and expansion as it integrated new acquisitions, rolled out market-leading technology, and won new business across the world. The company's focus on the digital guest journey has been central to its success, helping customers improve their guests' experience and drive increased revenues. Accesso's technology has helped clients upgrade the experiences they offer, and the company's ambition to support the largest operators has taken its business to every corner of the globe. Financial results for the year show revenue of $133.4m, up from $102.5m in 2016, and adjusted EBITDA of $24.6m, up from $19.1m. Accesso has delivered a 7-year revenue CAGR of 23.9% and a 7-year adjusted EBITDA CAGR of 32.2%. The company has evolved its offering to include a range of complementary technologies designed to meet a wide range of client needs and has increased the number of combined deployments of accesso technologies. Accesso is also expanding into new industry verticals, such as ski and snow sports, cultural attractions, museums, sports stadia, and live music events. The company's nearly 500 dedicated employees are the bedrock of its success, and accesso has started 2018 with new business wins, a significant contract extension with Cedar Fair, and an exciting new partnership with the Henry Ford Health System. CEO Steve Brown will be stepping down in April 2018 to be replaced by Paul Noland, who brings a wealth of industry experience from IAAPA, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and Marriott.In 2017, accesso made significant strides, winning a range of business across the Group and expanding geographically. New clients deployed accesso technology for the first time in India, Singapore, Thailand, Ireland, Portugal, and New Zealand. The company also progressed well with the rollout of technology related to its agreement with Merlin Entertainments Group Ltd. With the majority of the initial investment required to deliver on that project now behind them, accesso is well placed to begin benefiting from the longer-term international expansion opportunities. The company also focused on the smooth integration of Ingresso and TE2 into the accesso family, improving both the breadth and impact of their offering. accesso continued to expand its workforce to meet the growing demands of their scaling business, with the year-end non-seasonal employee count totaling nearly 500. In 2017, accesso saw a number of positive developments in their traditional verticals, such as theme and water park operators, with the continued rollout of accesso Prism, their state-of-the-art in-park wearable device. The company also made excellent progress in adjacent verticals, such as ski resorts, cultural attractions, tours, and live event ticketing. Last year's acquisitions of Ingresso and TE2 have brought a range of new capabilities to accesso, enabling the Group to make its first steps into new greenfield areas, including London's West End Theatre market and the Healthcare space. accesso aspires to be the premier technology solutions provider to the verticals it serves and continues to invest heavily to expand the functionality, effectiveness, and robustness of their technology across their full range of offerings. The company also focuses on information security, ensuring data minimization, more robust monitoring of their applications, enhanced response capabilities, and increased staff training across the whole business. accesso is pleased to report that the Group is showing good momentum at the start of 2018 and looks forward to a promising year ahead.
