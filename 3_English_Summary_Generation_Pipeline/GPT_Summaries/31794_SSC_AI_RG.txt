The company's performance is attributed to the attractive demographic opportunity and structural shortage of supply of retirement housing in the UK. Trading in the market was affected by uncertainty following the EU referendum, but the company managed to deliver solid results without any support from the government. The strong and experienced management team is focused on operational excellence and infrastructure to support the growth strategy of delivering more than 3,000 units per annum. The company's outlook remains positive as it capitalizes on the unprecedented demographic opportunity in which demand continues to dramatically exceed supply. The dividend for the year is in line with the progressive dividend policy, and the company has made several board changes during the year to strengthen its position.McCarthy & Stone's Chief Executive, Clive Fenton, reported improved results throughout the year despite increased uncertainty in the secondary market. Legal completions were slightly up, and the company has entered a new strategic relationship to access the growing rental market. The company continues to pursue its strategy of increasing the number of units per annum, with a focus on achieving its growth goal. Market demand remains strong, and McCarthy & Stone has formulated a tailored approach to sales, planning consents, and construction. The company has also made improvements in sales rates, reducing time to site sales launches, and accelerating sales rates in a challenging market. Development initiatives have focused on process improvements, planning processes, and increased standardization. The company has also continued to drive improvements in build quality and supply chain management.
