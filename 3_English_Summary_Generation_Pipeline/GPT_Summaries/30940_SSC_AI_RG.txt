The Property Franchise Group PLC is one of the largest franchised property businesses in the UK, with a network of over 400 offices. Their vision is to achieve an increasing UK market share of lettings and estate agency transactions using a proven franchise model and multiple, clearly differentiated property brands. The company has experienced significant growth, with a 23% increase in revenue in 2017, reaching £10.2m. They have expanded their UK network to 403 offices, serving around 52,000 tenanted managed properties. The group remains heavily weighted towards lettings, which accounts for 70% of Management Service Fees. They provide responsive local lettings and sales services nationally through recognized property brands, including Martin & Co, EweMove, CJ Hole, Parkers, Ellis & Co, and Whitegates. The company operates on a no sale, no fee basis and caters to both high street premises and online services. Their success is attributed to their multi-award-winning group and the growth of their network of franchises since 2005. The Property Franchise Group PLC currently manages 52,000 properties on behalf of landlords and has a growing presence in estate agency.The Property Franchise Group PLC experienced strong progress in 2017 despite market headwinds, with all of their brands increasing revenues year-on-year. This growth was supported by the 'assisted acquisitions' program, which helped lettings agents operationally and financially to purchase independent competitors' lettings businesses. In the first full year of the program, 2,012 tenanted managed properties were added, and an almost identical increase in the managed portfolio was achieved through organic growth. The EweMove franchise model, established in 2013, had 120 franchises by the end of the year, combining local property experts serving micro territories with a centralized 24/7 technology platform and traditional estate agency services. EweMove has been the UK's 'No 1 Most Trusted Agent' on Trustpilot since 2016. The government has provided clarity on its intention to ban tenant fees in England & Wales, with the ban expected to be implemented in Q1 2019. The Group is already taking action to mitigate the effects of the ban, which is expected to put at risk 16% of their franchisees' revenue.The Property Franchise Group experienced strong growth in 2017 despite a challenging residential property market. The Group's lettings revenue accounted for 9% of total revenue at a Group level. To mitigate potential impacts from the Tenant Fee Ban, the Group plans to accelerate the size of its tenanted managed portfolio, develop income from financial services and conveyancing referrals, and closely monitor any developments associated with the ban. In 2017, the Group redeveloped its five traditional brand websites, starting with Whitegates, to improve digital marketing capabilities. The new websites generated nearly 17,000 new business leads at an average cost of £24 per lead, providing a competitive advantage in H2 2017. The Company changed its name from MartinCo PLC to The Property Franchise Group PLC on 16 March 2017 to reflect its transformation from a single franchisor to a multi-franchisor of residential agents. The Group aims to be well-positioned for all eventualities and developments in the estate agency and letting agency space. The Board has recommended an increased final dividend of 5.4p per ordinary share for 2017.Chairman's Statement SummaryProperty Franchise Group's 2017 annual report and accounts statement
