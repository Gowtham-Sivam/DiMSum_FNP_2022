He has played a pivotal role in the growth and development of the Group's retail business over the past six years. Rand Merchant Investment Holdings Limited (RMI) acquired 29.9% of the Company's issued share capital on 1 March 2017, and as long as RMI holds at least 15% of the Company's issued share capital, they are entitled to appoint one Director to the Company's Board. Herman Bosman, CEO of RMI, was appointed as a Director of the Company on 14 March 2017. The diversity of the Board was reviewed by the Nomination Committee, and a detailed explanation of the Board-approved policy on diversity is set out in that Committee's report. Malcolm Le May tendered his resignation as a Non-Executive Director of the Company following his appointment as Group CEO of Provident Financial plc. The Company is now fully Code compliant with the composition of the Remuneration Committee. The Board remains confident in the Group's long-term prospects and is pleased to propose a final dividend of 8.5p per share, to be paid on 31 May 2018 to shareholders on the register on 4 May 2018 with an ex-dividend date of 3 May 2018. This is the Company's second dividend for the year, taking the full year dividend to 12.6p per share. This final dividend is subject to shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 24 May 2018. Mike Fairey, Chairman, expressed his gratitude to the management team and colleagues at Hastings for their hard work, commitment, and dedication contributing to the profitable and sustainable growth of the Group.Hastings Group has set four targets to achieve by 2019, including reaching 3 million customers, delivering a calendar year loss ratio within the range of 75-79%, reducing net debt leverage multiple to 1.0x, and maintaining a dividend payout ratio of 50-60%. The company has seen a 13% increase in policy numbers in 2017 and is confident in meeting its customer target. The majority of growth will come from the core motor book, with momentum from an increasing share of price comparison website sales, a profitable maturing book, and the launch of a new multicar proposition in 2018. Hastings has also started underwriting home insurance as a lead insurer in small volumes. The relationship with RMI, which acquired 29.9% of the company, has evolved with RMI's CEO joining the board and providing additional insights. Hastings has invested in colleagues to support future growth plans, attracting experienced professionals and introducing a new homeworking model. The company has also invested in Guidewire, a market-leading software that supports claims, broking, and billing, which will enable efficiencies and provide a platform for future growth. The outlook on premium rate increases is expected to follow claims inflation, with some uncertainty surrounding proposed changes to the Ogden rate and planned whiplash reforms. The impact of autonomous cars on the insurance industry is seen as many years away, with improvements in technology making repairs more expensive, offsetting benefits from lower accident frequency. Hastings focuses on local charitable and community initiatives, such as the 'Be the Change' program for local students. The company has achieved several milestones in 2017, including celebrating its 20th anniversary, doubling live customer policies since 2012, and RMI's investment showing long-term confidence in Hastings.
