The 2017 EnQuest PLC Annual Report highlights the company's performance, achievements, and outlook. EnQuest is an oil and gas production and development company that focuses on enhancing hydrocarbon recovery and extending the useful lives of mature and underdeveloped assets and associated infrastructure. In 2017, the company's production was 37,405 Boepd, a 6% decrease from the previous year, while cash capex was $367.6m, a 40% decrease. Unit opex increased by 4% to $25.6/Boe. Key achievements for the year included Kraken's first oil production in June, delivered on schedule with excellent drilling performance, and the completion of the acquisition of assets from BP in December, which required no immediate cash payment from EnQuest. The company's 2018 outlook includes a production range of 50,000 to 58,000 Boepd, a 33% to 50% increase, cash capex of around $250m, a 30% decrease, and unit opex of around $24/Boe, a 5% decrease. Kraken's production is expected to increase, with project capital expenditures reduced, and an extensive near-field drilling program is planned. Key risks for 2018 include a materially lower than expected production performance at the Kraken field and unexpected shutdowns on producing assets for an extended period of time.EnQuest delivered commendable operational achievements and strong safety performance in 2017, with first oil achieved at the Kraken project in June. This marked the start of improved operating cash flow and a material reduction in the Group's capital investment requirements. However, Group production of 37,405 Boepd in 2017 was disappointing, primarily due to performance issues at Alma/Galia and lower than planned production from Kraken and Scolty/Crathes. Despite these challenges, the Group took further steps to improve the balance sheet, delivering operating and capital expenditures in line with targets and completing a crude oil prepayment transaction and a refinancing agreement for its Tanjong Baram project in Malaysia. EnQuest also acquired interests in the Magnus oil field and the Sullom Voe Oil Terminal (SVT) from BP, adding to the material growth potential of its asset base. By the end of 2017, EnQuest had a net 2P reserve base of 210 MMboe, representing average growth of approximately 13% per annum since its formation eight years ago and a reserve life of around 17 years. The UKCS remains a compelling basin for investment, with exciting hydrocarbon opportunities, established infrastructure, access to a world-class supply chain, and a highly skilled workforce, all supported by a globally competitive fiscal regime. In 2018, EnQuest is entering a new phase, with Kraken progressing well, Magnus integration and drilling programs well underway, and plans being developed to enhance performance at other producing assets. These advances should result in EnQuest generating positive net cash flow after investment and tax, allowing the Company to continue managing its capital structure and liquidity position while prioritizing resources to key projects that maximize cash flow for debt reduction and long-term growth.EnQuest's Chief Executive, Amjad Bseisu, reports that 2017 was a transformational year for the company, transitioning from a period of heavy capital investment to one focused on reducing debt. The company's priorities included the Kraken development, completion of asset acquisitions from BP, and effective management of its financial position. Operational performance saw first oil from Kraken delivered on schedule, while the acquisition of initial interests in Magnus, SVT, and associated infrastructure from BP was completed safely and efficiently. However, overall production performance was disappointing, leading to a reduction in 2017 production guidance. EnQuest expects material production growth in 2018, driven by improving performance at Kraken and a full year's contribution from Magnus. Financial performance saw total operating expenditures of $349.3 million, unit opex of $25.6/Boe, and cash capital expenditure of $367.6 million. The company's focus on financial discipline resulted in EBITDA of $303.6 million, lower than 2016 due to lower realized prices and production. EnQuest's ongoing program of prudent measures to improve liquidity included the completion of an $80 million oil prepayment transaction and execution of a $37.25 million refinancing agreement in relation to its Tanjong Baram project. The company finished the year with net debt of $1,900.9 million, excluding Payment in Kind interest. EnQuest's focus on HSE&A performance saw good year-on-year improvement in 2017, with many assets recording an LTI-free year. The company's outlook for 2018 includes material production growth, unit opex of approximately $24/Boe, and cash capital expenditure of approximately $250 million. With production growing, a strong focus on cost control, and a substantially reduced cash capital expenditure program, EnQuest should see strong cash flow growth, enabling it to start reducing debt.
