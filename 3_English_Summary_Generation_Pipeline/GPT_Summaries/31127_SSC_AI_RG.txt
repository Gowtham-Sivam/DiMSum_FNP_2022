Kemin Resources Plc's Chairman's statement highlights the company's progress in obtaining license extensions for its Smirnovskoye and Drozhilovskoye projects in Kazakhstan. The Smirnovskoye license extension was approved and is valid until September 2019, while the Drozhilovskoye license is expected to be received in Q2 2018 after administrative delays. The company is now moving towards the production phase and has entered into talks with interested parties, particularly China Molybdenum, which has expertise in processing Kemin's minerals. The projects have become more economically viable due to stabilized commodity prices and the inclusion of lithium in profit generation models. A key step moving forward is to update and more clearly define the resources. Exploration drilling at the Drozhilovskoye site in Q1 2018 yielded encouraging results, and a Competent Persons Report under the JORC code will be commissioned soon to provide further external verification of the resources on both sites. The company is keen to press forward with development plans and sees the sourcing of a partner with skill and expertise in this area as extremely beneficial. Kemin has sufficient operational funds from its existing facility with Amrita Investments and will seek to source developmental funds as the project progresses.In the Chief Executive Officer's report, it is mentioned that Kemin Resources Plc is in the process of analyzing the latest drilling results at the Drozhilovskoye site, with plans to refine production techniques and establish a pilot plant for production at a later stage, subject to sourcing additional funding. The Smirnovskoye licence has been extended to September 2019, while the Drozhilovskoye licence extension is in the final administrative stages of sign off, expected in Q2 2018. The company is moving forward with the development of the sites, focusing on analyzing samples extracted at Drozhilovskoye to establish a production plan for extracting Molybdenum, Tungsten, and Lithium from the ore. The pilot plant is envisioned to have an initial run rate of 300,000t of ore per annum, with the full production plant processing approximately 3mt of ore. The latest drilling and analysis work has clarified the geological structure of the Drozhilovskoye field, confirming the presence of significant amounts of high-quality lithium and the isolation of tungsten and molybdenum minerals, allowing for selective mining.
