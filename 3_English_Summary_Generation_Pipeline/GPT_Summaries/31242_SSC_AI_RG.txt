In the Chairman's Statement, Lord Flight highlights the strong performance of Aurora Investment Trust in 2017, with an 18.5% increase, outperforming the benchmark FTSE All Share Index by 5.4%. Despite this, no performance fee was earned by Phoenix, the investment manager, due to the cumulative calculation of the fee. The share price of Aurora traded at a premium to NAV for most of the year, with an average premium of 1.5%, which helped attract new investors and grow the company through the issuance of new shares. The statement also discusses the two years of Phoenix management, emphasizing the importance of patience, discipline, and focus in their investment strategy. The proposed amendments to Aurora's Investment Policy, which would broaden the scope of investments, are also discussed and recommended for shareholder approval. The growth of the company remains a key objective, with a new target of increasing the size of Aurora to Â£200m over the next two to three years. Finally, the statement recommends a final dividend of 2.75p per share and invites shareholders to the AGM on 6 June 2018.
