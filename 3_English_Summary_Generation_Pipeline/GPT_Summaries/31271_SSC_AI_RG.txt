Serica Energy made strong progress in 2017, with gross profits from operations amounting to just under $20 million, a three-fold increase over the prior year. The company's acquisition of operated interests in the Bruce, Keith, and Rhum fields (BKR Assets) from BP has put them on track to achieve their goal of diversifying risk and growing into a profitable mid-tier independent oil and gas producer. The acquisition, with an effective date of 1 January 2018, is expected to bring material benefits to Serica upon completion in Q3 2018. Underlying reserves will have increased sixteen-fold to approximately 50 million boe, and the company's financial position is expected to increase commensurately. Following the transaction, Serica's production will be predominantly gas, with the Rhum and Bruce fields alone accounting for up to 5% of total UK gas production. The company is also working on the completion of the Lomond to Everest export line bypass during Q3, which is expected to deliver more consistent Erskine production performance and sales revenues.Serica Energy's Executive Chairman, Antony Craven Walker, expressed optimism about the company's future and its ability to consolidate recent acquisitions and build on the platform they have created. Their future plans include organic growth, developing their position in four North Sea producing fields, developing their Columbus interest, and commencing an exploration program with the Rowallan well. They will also review options for their interests in Namibia and Ireland, while continuing to seek ways to add new assets through selective acquisition to complement their strong production base and build a robust and exciting portfolio with further potential for value-generating growth. The company had a strong finish to 2017, delivering their highest profit to date and providing a platform for further growth. The announcement of the BKR Assets acquisition in late November rounded off an excellent year, and they believe that the UK North Sea will continue to provide new opportunities to grow the business and add shareholder value. Net production of 722,000 boe and operating profits of $14.1 million represent Serica's strongest annual performance to date. The acquisition of the BP interests in the BKR Assets will provide Serica with the opportunity to build on the experience gained from Erskine in order to move forward as a production operator. Serica remains committed to exploration and the forthcoming Rowallan well, targeting gross reserves over 100 million boe, is one of the few significant UK exploration wells due to be drilled in 2018.Serica Energy's CEO Mitch Flegg reported that the company's average production in Q1 2018 was 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day net to BP, due to interruptions from the FPS shut-in and severe weather conditions in the North Sea. Ofgem has approved the raising of the National Transmission System entry specification for CO2 content of gas delivered at the St Fergus Gas Terminal to 5.5mol% CO2, which will largely eliminate the need for costly blending gas. BP has contracted a rig to carry out the re-entry and re-completion of the Rhum R3 well, with operations expected to commence in May and production to start before the year-end. Serica will benefit from a 40% share of 2018 net cashflow from the acquired assets, rising to 100% in 2022. The company has selected the Shearwater hub as the optimum export route for Columbus gas and liquids, contingent on a near-term commitment being made by the Arran field partners to the construction of a pipeline from the Arran field to Shearwater. Serica has commenced the preparation of the field development plan, which is intended to be ready for submission by mid-2018. The Rowallan well will be Serica's first exploration well since 2014, with an independently assessed 19.7 million boe of P50 Prospective Resources net to Serica. A tender process is underway to contract a drilling rig to commence drilling of the exploration well in H2 2018. Serica intends to continue targeting exploration opportunities and has participated in three applications for new licences in the UKCS 30th Offshore Licensing Round.
