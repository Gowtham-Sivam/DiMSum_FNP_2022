Destiny Pharma, a biotech company focused on developing novel anti-infective drugs, successfully completed its IPO in September 2017, raising over £15 million. This funding has positioned the company to continue developing its drug pipeline, including its lead asset XF-73. Destiny Pharma was one of only two biotech companies to list in London in 2017, and the listing was supported by the collaboration with China Medical Systems (CMS), which became a major investor and key partner in the greater China region. The company is now well placed to continue the clinical development of its lead asset into Phase 2 studies and explore opportunities to collaborate and develop its earlier assets. Destiny Pharma is committed to addressing the global need for new anti-infective drugs that are effective and reduce the growing danger of antimicrobial resistance.Destiny Pharma, founded by Dr. Bill Love in 1997, initially conducted contract research for large pharmaceutical companies, focusing on novel surfaces for hip implantation, surface-bound photodynamic agents, and antimicrobial photodynamic agents. In 2003, the company had a major breakthrough with the creation of a new anti-bacterial drug platform, the XF drugs, which do not generate bacterial resistance unlike antibiotics. Destiny Pharma was admitted to AIM in September 2017, raising over £15 million, and signed a collaboration with China Medical Systems, who invested an additional £3 million in December 2017. In February 2018, the company successfully opened its first IND in the USA, was awarded fast-track status, and began its planned clinical program. Phase 2 studies are set to start later in 2018 and report data in 2019.
