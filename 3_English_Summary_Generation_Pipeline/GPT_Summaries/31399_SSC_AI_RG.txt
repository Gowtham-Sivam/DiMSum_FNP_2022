Key highlights show a decrease in cost of oil production per barrel (US$/bbl) from 40.82 in 2015 to 19.1 in 2017.Energean Oil & Gas Chairman Simon Heale highlights the company's significant progress in the Karish and Tanin project, the Prinos Basin expansion, and becoming a Premium Listed Company on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in March 2018. He attributes these achievements to a strong corporate culture, a focus on health, safety, and environmental (HSE) standards, and a professional management team. The company's board and management are committed to making Energean the leading independent operator in the Eastern Mediterranean while delivering value for shareholders and stakeholders. The board was chosen to ensure best practice governance standards and sound stewardship, with deep sector, financial, HSE, and capital markets expertise. As a Premium Listed Company, the board will comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code and has appointed audit, risk, governance, and remuneration committees to safeguard shareholders' interests and provide a strong governance framework. Energean's management team has over 200 years of combined experience in the oil and gas industry, and the senior management team are significant shareholders in the business, aligning their interests with other shareholders. The company is in a growth phase and does not anticipate paying a dividend until the Karish and Tanin development is completed. The board will review how it provides returns to shareholders regularly and will take a prudent approach that considers the level of profit generated by the Group's operations and the funding requirements for operations and exploration and development programs. Energean has a clear and substantially de-risked pathway to production growth with the Karish and Tanin, Prinos Basin, and Katakolo development programs, offering near-term value delivery, significant mid-term value, and longer-term potential upside.Energean Oil & Gas, established in 2007, has experienced considerable growth, investment, and achievement in the past decade. The company has expanded its operating footprint from one country to four, and from two licenses in Greece to 13 licenses in the Eastern Mediterranean. Energean has taken the prospective Karish and Tanin gas fields offshore Israel from acquisition in December 2016 to a Final Investment Decision (FID) in a short period. The company has signed 12 Long Term Gas Sales & Purchase Agreements with leading Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and industrial companies in Israel, securing substantial revenues for the next two decades. Energean's strategy is to maximize production, reserves, and cash flow from its existing low-cost production base while pursuing sustainable growth and returns through active development and exploration programs in the Eastern Mediterranean. The company has a strong health and safety track record and world-class industry partners such as TechnipFMC, BP, and Repsol. Energean is currently the only upstream company on the LSE with considerable exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean, an area attracting increasing interest from global oil and gas majors. As the company progresses through 2018, it aims to take advantage of this trend and be part of the substantial infrastructure developments that will connect the region to local and wider markets.In the Chairman's letter, Simon Heale highlights the Board's understanding of the benefits of diversity in maintaining and improving performance. The Board plans to establish a diversity policy in 2018, with key principles and implementation details to be presented in the 2018 Annual Report. The letter also mentions that an internal review of Board effectiveness will be undertaken in 2018, focusing on governance policies and procedures to identify areas for improvement in the corporate governance framework. Emphasis is placed on active engagement with shareholders and maintaining open and transparent communication, with the foundations for ongoing shareholder dialogue laid during the listing process. Looking ahead, 2018 is expected to be an important year for Energean as the Group continues to grow and focus on the development of Karish and Tanin, with high standards of governance being of critical importance. The Chairman looks forward to engaging with shareholders throughout the year and welcoming them to the first Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2018.
