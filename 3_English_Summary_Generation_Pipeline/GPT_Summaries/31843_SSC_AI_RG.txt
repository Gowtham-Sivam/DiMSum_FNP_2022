The Spanish market performed well, and the Events, Esports & Digital businesses saw excellent growth. The company invested £11.6 million during the year and ended with a cash position of £47.2 million. The Board decided not to declare a final dividend for the year in order to prioritize investment in BELONG and the UK store optimization program. Jackson expresses optimism in the long-term prospects for the Group, with a clear strategy and experienced team to lead the organization through this transformational period.In the Chief Executive Officer's Strategic Review, Martyn Gibbs discusses the challenges and opportunities faced by GAME Digital in the rapidly evolving video games industry. The company's 'GAME Changing' strategy focuses on realizing these opportunities, and although the financial results for the year were disappointing, significant strategic progress has been made. The company has continued to enhance its retail businesses, launching the 'GAME Elite' membership scheme in the UK and expanding into new categories such as digital content, PC gaming, and licensed merchandise. The company has also made significant progress in pioneering competitive gaming at a local level through its 'BELONG' gaming arena initiative, with plans to expand its footprint in the UK and launch its first arenas in Spain in 2018. The fast-moving dynamics of the industry demand agility and focus, leading the company to prioritize the development of its experience-based esports and competitive gaming proposition. Despite a 6.6% growth in GTV in the second half of the year, overall Group sales fell by 2.4% to £891.0 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was £8.0 million. However, strong working capital management helped increase the company's cash position to £47.2 million, with access to financing facilities of around £77 million, providing the necessary resources to drive future growth over the next 12 months.
