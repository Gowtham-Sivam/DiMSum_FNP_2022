In the Chairman's statement, it is highlighted that Cambian Group became a pure children's specialist education and behavioral health services business after selling its Adult Services business to Cygnet Health Care Limited in 2016. By the end of 2017, Cambian managed 222 facilities and employed over 4,500 staff, looking after 1,920 children and young people. The year 2017 was a year of transition for the company as it aimed to achieve modest growth and become the leading provider in children's services. Cambian has since undertaken a significant cost-cutting exercise, resulting in approximately £8.5 million of cost reductions on an annualized basis. The company has also repositioned itself towards a differentiated integrated recovery model for children with the highest needs, leading to the closure of certain facilities that could not be repositioned cost-effectively. The management team has been strengthened with several senior hires, and the focus has been on filling existing capacity, increasing fee levels, and reducing the cost base to increase margins. The company's revenue increased by 8% to £196.0 million in 2017, with adjusted EBITDA at £18.7 million. Cambian's future strategy is to be the highest quality provider of specialist education and behavioral health services for children, focusing on areas with high severity of need and aiming to build the industry's best leadership and workforce.Cambian Group's Chief Executive's strategic review for the Annual Report and Accounts 2017 highlights a 15% increase in adjusted EBITDA to £18.7 million, with adjusted EBITDA margins of 9.5%. This growth is attributed to revenue growth and cost savings in head office functions, although it was offset by one-off impacts from the sale of the Adult Services business and a provision for changes in legislation regarding staff sleep-ins. The operating profit before exceptional items was £2.4 million, with a statutory operating loss of £8.8 million. Average occupancy remained stable at 1,286 places, with an underlying transition towards higher severity cases. Average utilization increased to 78% following a planned reduction in operational capacity. In the fostering division, average occupancy was 634, with 649 placements at the end of the year. The company focused on reducing central costs and aligning the business with its new scale and focus on Children's Services, resulting in a reduced cost base and further operational efficiencies expected in 2018 and 2019. The management team was also significantly strengthened with key appointments, including Anoop Kang as CFO, Rob Walker as People Director, and Dr. Sharon Menghini as Director of Children's Services.
