The Key Highlights section includes 52 notes on the company's financial statements, a 5-year statistical record, and the 2017 annual report for Electronic Data Processing PLC.In the Chairman's Statement, Sir Michael Heller reports that the turnover for the year ending 30 September 2017 was £5.11 million, a 3% increase from the previous year's £4.96 million. Adjusted operating profit also increased by 26% to £540,000, compared to £430,000 last year. This increase in sales had a significant impact on operating profit due to management's tight control on maintaining overheads at similar levels to the previous year. Statutory pre-tax profit for the year increased by 71% to £417,000, compared to £244,000 the prior year. Contracted recurring revenues remained strong at 80% of total revenues, with revenues delivered through the company's hosting center increasing to 61% of total revenues. R&D cash expenditure for the year was £901,000, primarily focused on enhancing key products Quantum VS and Vecta. The company sold its remaining surplus freehold property for £1.2 million in December 2016, generating more than £7 million of cash from the disposal of six freehold properties over the years. This has supported distributions to shareholders in excess of £11 million. At the year end, cash balances were £6.4 million, compared to £5.4 million last year, with the increase reflecting the proceeds from the sale of property. Net assets at 30 September 2017 were £6.4 million, compared to £3.2 million at 30 September 2016, due to the elimination of the deficit on the defined benefit pension scheme under IAS 19.The Chief Executive's Statement reveals that Electronic Data Processing PLC's revenue for the year increased by 3% to £5.11 million, compared to £4.96 million the previous year. The company's underlying operating profitability also increased by 26% to £540,000 from £430,000 a year earlier. The Directors are proposing to pay a final dividend of 3.0p per share, giving a total dividend for the year of 5.0p, the same as last year. The strategic review of the business, announced last year, has been impacted by uncertainty over the pension scheme valuation since March 2017, causing it to take longer than expected. However, the process is continuing now that the actuarial valuation of the scheme has been completed. The company will update shareholders further when it is in a position to do so. With a strong, cash-generative business model and a debt-free balance sheet, the business is well positioned for the future.
