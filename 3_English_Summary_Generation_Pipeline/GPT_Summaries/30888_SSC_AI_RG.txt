Spectris has reported a positive year in terms of operational performance and strategic delivery, with strong organic growth. The Group's financial position remains robust, with net debt at £50.5 million at the year end. The Board is proposing a final dividend of 37.5 pence per share, an increase of 9%, which will be paid on 29 June 2018 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 May 2018. The Group has approved a share buy-back programme of £100 million to take place during 2018 and into 2019, following the sale of Microscan in October 2017, which generated post-tax cash proceeds of approximately £91.9 million. Spectris aims to enhance its profitable growth by providing customers with key insights alongside its instruments, progressively adding software and analytical capabilities and test services to its product offerings. The Group has historically focused on the benefits gained from a decentralized operating model, but has started to evolve its operating model to increase coordination between companies across key business functions and to leverage its scale. Project Uplift is now in progress to optimize efficiency and effectiveness within and across operating companies. Spectris has made a number of key appointments to lead significant Group-wide initiatives, including digital platform development, key account management, lean initiatives, human resources management, and improved supply chain management. The Group's ethics and values are central to its decision-making, ensuring compliance with the highest standards. Spectris is well positioned for the future, with strategic initiatives in place to deliver value to both customers and shareholders.Spectris operates through four business segments: Industrial Controls, In-line Instrumentation, Materials Analysis, and Test and Measurement. Industrial Controls offers products and solutions for measuring, monitoring, controlling, and connecting during the production process, with reported sales of £262.5m and adjusted operating profit of £38.3m. In-line Instrumentation provides process analytical measurement, asset monitoring, and online controls, with reported sales of £310.9m and adjusted operating profit of £33.2m. Materials Analysis offers products and services for determining structure, composition, quantity, and quality of particles and materials, with reported sales of £464.9m and adjusted operating profit of £83.1m. Test and Measurement supplies test, measurement, and analysis equipment, software, and services, with reported sales of £487.3m and adjusted operating profit of £68.9m. The company's business model is characterized by high barriers to entry, long-term customer relationships, market-leading brands, broad geographical and end-market exposure, asset-light manufacturing, and an acquisition strategy that supplements organic growth.Spectris' Chief Executive, John O'Higgins, highlighted the company's good performance in 2017, with like-for-like increases in sales and profit. The company's strategy is evolving towards providing complete solutions to customers, based on deep application and technical expertise. Spectris completed several bolt-on acquisitions in 2017, including Setpoint, Omnicon, and CSA Leyland Technical Centre. In 2018, the company acquired Concept Life Sciences, which provides integrated drug discovery, development, analytical testing, and environmental consultancy services. Spectris has made investments in new central leadership appointments in lean, supply chain, software, and digital to drive strategic initiatives. The company has also been reviewing its digital-led customer applications, with the potential for more cross-group solutions. Spectris divested its machine vision technology business, Microscan, in October 2017, resulting in post-tax cash proceeds of £91.9 million. Project Uplift, aimed at increasing productivity and reducing complexity, is expected to deliver annual savings of £25 million at a total cost of £35 million over the period to the end of 2019. Spectris remains focused on implementing its strategy to provide a broader offering to customers and will continue to make acquisitions to support this strategy as it expands its software and services capability.
