3 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION 3 STRATEGIC REPORT GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CORPORATE INFORMATION “Our objective is to become one of the leading 
hotel groups in the Caribbean in order to 
deliver sustainable investor returns”
Simon Sherwood 
Chairman
T
he Group has 
delivered a solid 
performance 
in the financial year 
ended 30 September 
2017 against a 
background of changed 
market conditions. 
We were encouraged 
to see occupancy 
recover in H2 2017 
which, together with the 
addition of Waves Hotel 
to the portfolio, led to a 
revenue increase of 5% 
over 2016.
The team remains firmly focused 
on delivering our strategy, and we 
are pleased with the operational 
progress that has been made during 
the year. We have continued to strive 
for day-to-day excellence, investing 
in our people and systems to ensure 
that our hotels continue to provide 
exceptional guest experiences, as 
well as successfully expanding our 
sales and marketing presence in the 
US in order to drive further growth in 
visitor numbers from that market. 
We have also continued with 
our programme of refurbishing, 
repositioning and repricing elements 
of the existing portfolio. This has 
included enhancements to The 
House, which re-opened in October 
2017 after being closed for six weeks, 
and the addition of new food and 
beverage outlets at two of our 
all-inclusive properties – Crystal 
Cove and Turtle Beach. Daphne’s, 
our beachfront restaurant, was also 
closed for renovation for six weeks 
in H1.
During the year, we expanded 
outside of Barbados through a 
management contract for Hodges 
Bay Resort & Spa (Hodges Bay) in 
Antigua and a sales and marketing 
contract for The Landings Resort 
& Spa (The Landings) in St Lucia. 
The Landings contract is progressing 
well and enables us to expand our 
sales and marketing footprint.
The construction of Hodges Bay 
is currently taking longer than 
expected but we’re pleased that the 
owners are ensuring that this product 
is built to the highest standards. 
We continue to believe that 
management contracts and sales 
and marketing agreements represent 
compelling opportunities.
