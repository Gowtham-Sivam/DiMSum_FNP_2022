With a stable Board, senior management team, and award-winning brands, the company looks forward to delivering on its refreshed strategy to ensure growth and increased shareholder returns.Stock Spirits Group's financial performance in 2017 showed evidence of stabilization and turnaround, with growth in volume, share, revenues, profitability, and cash flow. The balance sheet was further strengthened as net debt was reduced and financing facilities were extended. In Poland, the company focused on embedding changes initiated in 2016, including strengthening and optimizing the business to better compete in an intensely competitive market. The vodka market continued to grow, with clear vodka being the main variant. Despite aggressive pricing in economy and mainstream segments, consumers were up-trading to more premium and prestige brands, benefiting Stock Spirits Group. The traditional trade remained the key vodka trade channel, and one competitor's withdrawal from direct involvement in this channel presented another opportunity for the company. In terms of brands, the focus was on distribution-build and consumer-activation over new product development. The company's biggest brand, Żołᶏdkowa de Luxe, returned to growth in sales, outperforming both the overall and clear vodka categories. The Czech business delivered robust results, extending leadership in the overall market. The spirits category continued to grow in volume and value, supported by the economy performing well and earnings rising. In Italy, the market continued to be challenging, with high young-adult unemployment impacting brands, primarily Keglevich. The overall spirits category grew slightly, mainly through limoncello, gin, and aperitifs. In Slovakia, the business delivered solid performance, with the Golden Ice range strengthening the company's position in the premium fruit spirits sub-category. The company also saw good performance in Croatia and Bosnia. With a strengthened team and a more resilient Polish business, combined with a strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, Stock Spirits Group is well placed to exploit opportunities to expand its business.The Chairman's letter in the Stock Spirits Group PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2017 explains the key features of the company's governance structure, highlighting how the main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code have been applied during the year.
