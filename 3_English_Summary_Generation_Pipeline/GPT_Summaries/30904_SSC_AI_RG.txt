In his second statement since joining the Group, Chairman Michael Findlay reports a strong performance in 2017, with a commitment to values and focus on delivering the company's strategy. The Group achieved growth in 2017, ending the year with a robust balance sheet, allowing for flexibility to invest in the business. Revenue for the year was up 9% at £2,793m, with adjusted profit before tax up 46% to £66.1m. The cash performance of the Group remained strong due to disciplined monitoring of average daily cash levels and tight management of working capital. Core values and Total Commitments to being a responsible business are at the heart of the company's culture, supporting strategic objectives and underpinning performance. The company has stayed focused on its strategy of specializing in construction and regeneration, targeting markets where demand is stable or growing and divisions have the experience and ability to deliver. The total dividend for the year has been increased by 29% to 45.0p per share, reflecting the improved result in the year and the Board's confidence in the future prospects of the Group. Looking ahead, the Board will ensure that divisions engage in continuous succession planning, training and development, as well as initiatives to increase diversity and inclusiveness, to have the best people in place to deliver the company's strategy and growth over the long term.The Chief Executive's statement highlights the strong results and significant operational progress made across the Group in 2017, with growth in all divisions providing an encouraging platform for future progress. Fit Out delivered an excellent performance with revenue growth of 16% to £735m and significant margin improvement to 5.3%, while Construction & Infrastructure improved its operating margin to 1.5% and operating profit to £20.4m. Progress in Property Services was impacted by restructuring costs, resulting in a loss of £1.3m, but the division is now better positioned for future growth. Partnership Housing increased its operating profit by 5% to £14.1m, and Urban Regeneration reported an operating profit of £10.0m. Investments made progress in developing its portfolio of property partnerships, delivering a small profit of £0.5m. The Group's positive cash generation and increase in average net cash has further strengthened its balance sheet, providing flexibility for investment in regeneration activities and allowing for selective bidding in construction activities. The Group achieved its strategic objectives, targeting growth sectors within the UK such as housing, infrastructure, and urban regeneration, all supported by government commitment. Each division has succeeded in pursuing its business strategy, with Construction & Infrastructure focusing on operational delivery and contract selectivity, Fit Out winning work in targeted sectors, and Property Services delivering maintenance services to over 25 social housing providers. Partnership Housing made progress in developing partnerships with housing associations and local authorities, while Urban Regeneration entered into an agreement with the Greater London Authority for a 2.2-hectare site in Canning Town and started on site with the fourth phase of its regeneration scheme in Warrington. Investments' successful regeneration programs in Slough and Bournemouth are growing, and the division is providing collaborative opportunities for other parts of the Group through its schemes. The Group's commitment to being a responsible business is integral to achieving its strategic objectives, and it achieved FTSE4Good Index Status in 2017. The Group is also committed to the health and safety of all who come into contact with its business, with a significant improvement in overall health and safety performance over the past three years. The Group's prospects for 2018 and beyond look very positive, with a committed order book of £3.8bn and a regeneration and development pipeline of £3.2bn. The Group expects continued margin progression in Construction & Infrastructure, strong performance from Fit Out, further growth from Urban Regeneration and Partnership Housing, and positive contributions from Property Services and Investments, resulting in a year-end result slightly above previous expectations.
