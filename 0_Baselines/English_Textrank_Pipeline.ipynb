      "At its meetings, the Committee focused on the following main areas:\n",
      "Financial reporting \n",
      "The primary role of the Committee in relation to financial reporting has been to review, with management and the external auditor,  \n",
      "the appropriateness of the interim and annual financial statements concentrating on, amongst other matters:\n",
      "■ ■ the quality and acceptability of accounting policies and practices;\n",
      "■ ■ the application and impact of significant judgements or matters where there was significant discussion with the external auditor;\n",

      "■ ■ whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for \n",
      "shareholders to assess the Group’s strategy, business model and performance.\n",
      "Reports from management were considered on significant matters, including in respect of litigation, treasury and tax matters and also \n",
      "reports from the external auditor on the outcome of their work. The Committee challenged both management and Deloitte to ensure that \n",
      "the scope of the audit was appropriate and that Deloitte had applied the necessary level of professional scepticism in their work. \n",
      "Areas of focus\n",
      "The areas of focus considered by the Committee in relation to the 2017 Annual Report included the following:\n",
      "■ ■ Impairment of goodwill. The Committee challenged the future forecast underlying the value in use calculation, and the assumptions, \n",
      "particularly the discount rate and growth factors, used in the discounted cash flow calculations for each cash generating unit, the \n",
      "sensitivity analysis applied and the projected future cash flows used to support the carrying values of the goodwill. Details of sensitivity \n",
      "analysis applied to key assumptions used in the impairment review are set out in note 11 to the Financial Statements on page 108. The \n",
      "Committee has concluded that no impairment charge is required in the year.\n",
      "■ ■ Restructuring, reorganisation and environmental provisions. The Committee received reports, including from professional advisers, and \n",
      "challenged the basis and completeness of the assumptions used to calculate the provisions and the appropriateness of disclosures in \n",
      "the Report. The Committee discussed with management the key judgements behind provisions, taking note of the range of possible \n",
      "outcomes, and agreed with their recommendations.\n",
      "■ ■ Taxation. A number of judgements are involved in calculating tax provisions and the level of deferred tax assets to be recognised. The \n",
      "Committee reviewed associated risks and challenged management’s assessment concerning the Group’s key tax risks, noting the  \n",
      "work of the OECD in respect of Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), and management’s forecast of the future taxable profits of  \n",
      "the relevant businesses.\n",
      "■ ■ Viability Statement. The Committee challenged the validity of the assumptions used in the preparation of the three year strategic plan, \n",
      "used as the basis of the assessment of the longer-term viability of the Group, in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits \n",
      "and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken  \n",
      "to consider the impact of certain risks and to understand the impact of changes to all key variables.\n",
      "■ ■ Going concern. The Committee challenged the validity of the going concern assumption used in the preparation of the Annual Report, \n",
      "in particular considering the Group’s forecast for profits and cash generation, its liquidity position, available borrowing facilities and \n",
      "covenant compliance. Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to understand the impact of changes to key variables.\n",
      "■ ■ Pension liabilities. Management took external professional advice in determining pension liabilities. The Committee challenged the \n",
      "assumptions used, particularly in respect of inflation, the discount rate, life expectancy and the application of IFRIC 14 to the UK pension \n",
      "scheme, by considering current norms and the sensitivity of the reported liability to changes in the assumptions.\n",
      "Risk management\n",
      "The Committee reviewed a report at each meeting from the Group Head of Risk who has primary responsibility for developing the Group’s \n",
      "risk management framework. The Committee reviewed changes to the principal risks and mitigating actions identified by management. The \n",
      "Committee also received quarterly reports on issues raised via the Open Door Line (an external independent service where employees may \n",
      "report matters of concern) and assessed both how such calls are dealt with and whether there was any indication of material risk. During 2017 \n",
      "there were 15 Open Door Cases, all of which were investigated and closed during the year, with appropriate action taken where necessary.\n",
      "Internal control\n",
      "At each meeting the Committee considered and challenged reports from the internal auditors on the effectiveness of internal controls. \n",
      "The Committee also performed an annual review of the Group’s internal control processes and considers the system to be effective and in \n",

      "(September 2014).\n",
      "Internal audit\n",
      "The internal audit plan for 2018 was presented to the Committee in October 2017 and accepted following discussions and challenge as to \n",
      "the scope and areas of focus. At each meeting the Group Head of Risk presented a report to the Committee on the status of internal audit \n",
      "plans for the current year, points arising from audits completed and follow up action plans to address areas of weakness. The status of \n",
      "these actions is monitored closely by the Committee until they are completed. The Committee also received reports on actual or suspected \n",
      "frauds and thefts by third parties and employees. None had any material financial impact on the Group and, where necessary, systems and \n",

      "Committee considered and challenged both the scope and materiality to be applied to the Group audit and its components. The Committee \n",

      "the preparation of certain sections of the Annual Report to individuals in the head office team and a second person taking responsibility for \n",
      "the review process of each section of the Annual Report. Additional reviews were carried out by internal and external personnel including  \n",

      "The review of the Group’s Interim report was the only significant non-audit engagement undertaken by the external auditor. Given the \n",

      "Internal audit\n",

      "Additional assurance has been obtained through control self-assessment. Internal auditors have received self-certification from every \n",
      "plant and shared service centre that internal controls have been complied with and noting any non-compliance. A summary of results is \n",

      "The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The \n",
      "financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial \n",
      "statements comply with Article 4 of EU IAS Regulation as adopted for use in the EU.\n",
      "The Group has adopted Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International \n",
      "Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB (IFRIC). Individual standards and interpretations have to be adopted by the \n",
      "European Commission (EC) and the process leads to a delay between the issue and adoption of new standards and in some cases \n",
      "amendment by the EC.\n",
      "International Financial Reporting Standards are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the EC and \n",
      "are therefore subject to change.\n",
      "The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, with the exception of accounting for certain financial instruments. \n",
      "Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies \n",
      "adopted are set out below.\n",
      "Going concern\n",
      "The directors have at the time of approving the financial statements a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have \n",
      "adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis  \n",
      "of accounting in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is contained in the Chief Financial Officer’s report on page 24.\n",
      "Basis of consolidation\n",
      "The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its \n",
      "subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and \n",
      "operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.\n",
      "The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date \n",
      "of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of \n",
      "subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group. All intra-group transactions, balances, income and \n",
      "expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n",
      "Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling \n",
      "shareholders that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation may initially \n",
      "be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.\n",
      "The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially measured at fair value.\n",
      "Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the \n",
      "non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even \n",
      "if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n",
      "Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying \n",
      "amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the \n",
      "subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration \n",
      "paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.\n",
      "When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate \n",
      "of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the \n",
      "assets (including goodwill), less liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognised in other \n",
      "comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained \n",
