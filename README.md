FNS 2022 Task Repo

This repo has been created to work on the task FNS 2022 http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/cfie/fns2022/

## Task Introduction

The volume of available financial information is increasing sharply and therefore the study of NLP methods that automatically summarise content has grown rapidly into a major research area.

The Financial Narrative Summarisation (FNS 2022) aims to demonstrate the value and challenges of applying automatic text summarisation to financial text written in English, Spanish and Greek, usually referred to as financial narrative disclosures. The task dataset has been extracted from UK annual reports published in PDF file format.

The participants are asked to provide structured single summaries, based on real-world, publicly available financial annual reports of UK firms by extracting information from different key sections. Participants will be asked to generate summaries that reflects the analysis and assessment of the financial trend of the business over the past year, as provided by annual reports.

## Summaries Evaluation

For the evaluation we aim to use the Rouge Java package.

ROUGE 2 will be the main metric for teams and submission comparisons (Ranking). Teams will be ranked according to the highest F1-Score on the Test set.
